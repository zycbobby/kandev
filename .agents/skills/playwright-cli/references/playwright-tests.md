# Running Playwright Tests

For Kandev E2E tests, use the guarded `e2e:raw` or `e2e:run` package script. These runners keep Playwright at one worker and reject unsafe overrides. To avoid opening the interactive HTML report, use `PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never`.

```bash
# Run all tests
cd apps/web && PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never pnpm e2e:raw

# Run all tests through a custom npm script
PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never npm run special-test-command
```

# Debugging Playwright Tests

To debug a failing Playwright test, run it with `--debug=cli` option. This command will pause the test at the start and print the debugging instructions.

**IMPORTANT**: run the command in the background and check the output until "Debugging Instructions" is printed.

Once instructions containing a session name are printed, use `playwright-cli` to attach the session and explore the page.

```bash
# Run the test
cd apps/web && PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN=never pnpm e2e:raw -- --debug=cli
# ...
# ... debugging instructions for "tw-abcdef" session ...
# ...

# Attach to the test
playwright-cli attach tw-abcdef
```

Keep the test running in the background while you explore and look for a fix.
The test is paused at the start, so you should step over or pause at a particular location
where the problem is most likely to be.

Every action you perform with `playwright-cli` generates corresponding Playwright TypeScript code.
This code appears in the output and can be copied directly into the test. Most of the time, a specific locator or an expectation should be updated, but it could also be a bug in the app. Use your judgement.

After fixing the test, stop the background test run. Rerun to check that test passes.
