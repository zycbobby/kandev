<!--
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — read this before filling in the template below.

Generate each section using the rules below. Remove a section entirely if it adds no value for the size of the change. Remove all agent instruction comments from the final output.

SUMMARY (required)
  1–2 sentences max. Do not include a "Summary" heading — write directly as prose.
  Lead with the problem or goal, end with the outcome.
  Say WHY, not what. No filler phrases ("This PR...", "In order to...", "As part of...").

LANGUAGE
  Write the PR title, body, captions, and review-facing prose in English.
  Translate non-English task text before recording it. Do not include the original wording in the PR body.
  Keep non-English text only for intentional product localization or exact product data required by the diff.
  Keep the surrounding explanation in English.

ARCHITECTURE AND SCOPE
  If the change is large or architectural, require a linked issue with maintainer discussion before opening the PR.
  Large changes include new subsystems, public API or protocol changes, persistence changes, new execution boundaries,
  authentication or permission-model changes, and cross-cutting changes across subsystems.
  If the issue or discussion is missing, stop and report the blocker. Do not open a PR to start the discussion.
  Prefer one logical change and the smallest practical diff. Split unrelated cleanup, refactoring, and feature work.

IMPORTANT CHANGES (optional)
  Include only for significant architectural changes. Skip for small or straightforward changes.
  Very short bullet list. Each bullet says WHAT changed and why (very short).

VALIDATION (required)
  How this was tested or verified. List commands or checks run (e.g. `go test ./...`, `make lint`).

DIAGRAM (optional)
  Include a Mermaid diagram only when it genuinely helps the reader understand a non-obvious flow,
  architecture change, or component relationship. Skip if the change is self-explanatory.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS (optional)
  One line: risk level + what could go wrong or be improved. Skip if negligible.

RELATED ISSUES
  Use "Closes #N" if this resolves an issue. Remove the line if there is no related issue.

RULES
  - Do not add "🤖 Generated with..." or any tool attribution footer.
  - Do not leave placeholder text or unfilled sections in the output.
  - Render the final PR body without any of these instruction comments.
  - Always keep the Checklist section as-is; do not remove or pre-fill its items.

## Checklist

- [ ] If this is a large architectural change, I discussed the direction in a linked issue before opening this PR.
- [ ] This PR contains one logical change; unrelated work is split into separate PRs.
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code.
- [ ] I have manually tested my changes and they work as expected.
- [ ] My changes have tests that cover the new functionality and edge cases.
- [ ] If my change touches UI files (`apps/web/`), I have added or updated Playwright e2e tests in `apps/web/e2e/` and verified them with `make test-e2e`.
- [ ] I checked whether this affects public docs in `docs/public/**` and updated them or noted why no docs change is needed.
