# Task 03: Layout Settings Editor

## Acceptance

- `Settings > General > Layouts` manages built-in layouts and custom profiles through the shared floating save coordinator, navigation guard, and page-level error state.
- Built-in edits remain on one visible row, create a hidden override marked `Customized`, and can be restored with Reset.
- Selecting a tab exposes contextual split/tab actions with hover/focus descriptions; adding panels remains a separate floating action.
- The isolated preview supports reusable panel add/remove, tab reorder, active-tab choice, and split create/move/resize without mounting runtime task panels.
- Every operation is reachable by pointer, keyboard, and touch; the mobile page has no horizontal page scroll.
