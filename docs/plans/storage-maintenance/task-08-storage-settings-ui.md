# Task 08: Responsive Storage settings UI

Build the desktop and mobile System Storage surface with safe confirmations and persisted feedback.

## Acceptance

- The page supports analysis, settings persistence, manual run, resource results, run history,
  quarantine restore, and confirmed permanent deletion without component-level direct fetching.
- Dedicated-Docker and external-Go-cache warnings are explicit; disabled/unavailable actions explain
  why, and async jobs recover through WS plus polling fallback.
- At Pixel 5 width, every action is reachable through the settings sheet, cards stack without page
  overflow, long paths wrap, and touch actions are at least 44 px high.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck
cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web lint
cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test
```

## Inputs
