# Implementation Plan: Claude Passthrough Quiet Default

## Overview

Remove the forced Claude verbose flag from the built-in passthrough command.
Keep verbose output available through the existing profile CLI-flags field.

The confirmed root cause is the `--verbose` token in
`NewClaudeACP().PassthroughConfig().PassthroughCmd`. The standard passthrough
builder cannot disable a base-command token, so every Claude passthrough launch
receives the flag.

## Scope

### In scope

- Make the built-in Claude passthrough command quiet by default.
- Preserve explicit `--verbose` opt-in through profile CLI flags.
- Add regression tests for both command forms.
- Document the quiet default and the verbose opt-in path.
- Keep the settings command preview aligned with the launched passthrough
  command.

### Out of scope

- A new profile setting or user-interface control.
- Changes to ACP launches, other agents, or Claude output rendering.
- Migration of existing agent profiles.

## Technical approach

Add a focused test file beside `claude_acp.go`. First, prove that the current
base command violates the quiet-default contract. Then remove only the
hardcoded `--verbose` token.

Use `BuildPassthroughCommand` in the opt-in test. This boundary proves that the
existing `CLIFlagTokens` path adds `--verbose` without a new setting.

Update the CLI-flags reference in `docs/public/agents-and-profiles.md`. State
that Claude passthrough uses standard output by default and that `--verbose` is
an explicit profile flag.

Pass resolved profile CLI flags through the passthrough branch of
`Controller.PreviewAgentCommand`, so the settings preview matches runtime.

## Tests

| Acceptance criterion | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `AC-CLI-PASSTHROUGH-LAUNCH-001.1` | `TestClaudeACP_PassthroughCmd_DefaultOmitsVerbose` compares the base argv with the quiet command. |
| `AC-CLI-PASSTHROUGH-LAUNCH-001.2` | `TestClaudeACP_PassthroughCmd_VerboseOptIn` builds a command with `CLIFlagTokens` and expects `--verbose`. |
| `AC-CLI-PASSTHROUGH-LAUNCH-001.3` | The focused agent package tests preserve existing command-composition coverage. |
| `AC-CLI-PASSTHROUGH-LAUNCH-001.4` | The opt-in test uses the current profile token input and requires no model change. |
| `AC-CLI-PASSTHROUGH-LAUNCH-001.5` | `TestController_PreviewAgentCommand_PassthroughIncludesCLIFlags` proves that preview output includes the enabled profile flag. |

## E2E tests

No browser E2E test is planned. The change has no user-interface path, and a
live Claude dependency would not give deterministic repository evidence.

The agent-package test covers the complete Kandev-owned command argv. Anthropic
owns the output that each argv mode renders.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Make Claude passthrough quiet by default](task-01-quiet-claude-passthrough.md)

## Verification results

- RED: `go test ./internal/agent/agents -run
  '^TestClaudeACP_PassthroughCmd_' -count=1` failed two tests before the
  production change. The default argv contained the forced flag, and explicit
  opt-in produced a duplicate flag.
- GREEN: The focused command passed two tests after the production change.
- Fixup RED: The controller preview regression failed before the passthrough
  branch passed `CLIFlagTokens` to the builder.
- Fixup GREEN: The preview now forwards resolved profile CLI flags, and the
  passthrough builder removes duplicate permission CLI tokens so preview and
  runtime stay identical. Focused controller tests passed, including the
  existing no-duplicate regression.
- Full agent package: `go test ./internal/agent/agents -count=1` passed 260
  tests; the controller package passed 237 tests.
- Specification lint passed all files, and the CLI catalog now reports 3
  requirements and 1 design.
- Public documentation: `node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs`
  passed 61 tests, and `node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs` validated 41
  published pages.
- `git diff --check` and `gofmt -l` passed for changed Go files.

## Risks

- A user who depended on forced verbose output must add `--verbose` to that
  profile.
- An overly broad command change can damage model, resume, permission, prompt,
  or MCP arguments. The implementation changes one base token only.
