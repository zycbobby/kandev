# Task 01: Isolate reused pull-request refs

## Summary

Prepare each pull-request head through a PR-scoped internal ref. Preserve any
same-named local branch that contains different history.

## In scope

- Fetch and verify a pull-request head without updating the named local branch.
- Create a unique task branch when the named branch has unrelated history.
- Preserve Git admission, timeout, credential, and cancellation behavior.

## Out of scope

- Provider-history reconciliation after launch.
- Remote branch mutation.
- Changes to non-pull-request local branch refresh.

## Acceptance

- Two pull requests can reuse one head-branch name without a fetch conflict.
- The new worktree starts at the requested pull-request head.
- The prior local branch and its commit remain unchanged.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/worktree -race
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/worktree/manager_lifecycle.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/worktree/manager_pr_head_collision_test.go`

## Dependencies

None.

## Risks

- Ref cleanup must not remove a user-owned ref.
- A local-ahead branch must keep its local-only commits.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Task launch failure recovery design, pull-request checkout isolation.
- Remote contribution task requirement `AC-TASKS-REMOTE-CONTRIBUTION-TASKS-001.2`.
- ADR `2026-08-10-remote-contribution-head-drift`.

## Results

- Added a Kandev-owned `refs/kandev/pull/<N>/head` fetch ref with full-ref
  verification and typed `ErrWorkspaceCheckoutFailed` failures.
- PR worktrees now create a unique local branch when the requested source name
  already exists, without resetting or updating that branch. The fallback
  uses a task-owned suffix and bounded retries for branch-name collisions.
- PR worktrees only track the source branch when its remote-tracking commit
  matches the verified PR head. Ordinary `fetch --all --prune` cannot remove
  or replace the internal snapshot.
- Recreate restores deleted PR branches from the isolated ref.
- Verification passed: `go test ./internal/worktree` (368 passed).
