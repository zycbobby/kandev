# Task 01: Protect secret references

## Summary

Show secret-reference conflicts before deletion, reject unsafe deletion, and explain how to repair an existing missing reference.

## In scope

- Service guards, HTTP/WS conflict and force contracts, read-only reference preflight, responsive confirmation UI, runtime errors, and public documentation.

## Out of scope

- Automatic rebinding, scope transfers, concurrent save serialization, and worktree recovery.

## Acceptance

- Existing references block ordinary deletion. Force requires existing secret authorization.
- The delete flow loads direct references before confirmation and replaces destructive actions with a contained conflict dialog when any exist.
- The final delete operation repeats the reference scan so references created after preflight still block deletion.
- Lookup errors fail closed. Responses disclose no secret values or unauthorized repository details.
- Runtime errors identify the key and source and give a repair instruction.

## Verification

From `apps/backend`:

```bash
go test ./internal/secrets ./internal/agent/runtime/environment
go test ./internal/backendapp -run TestSecretReference -count=1
go test ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle -run 'TestSecretRecovery|TestResolveStrict' -count=1
```

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs
git diff --check
```

From `apps/web`:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run components/settings/secret-delete-error.test.ts components/settings/secrets-settings.test.ts components/settings/secrets-list-item-row.test.tsx
pnpm exec eslint components/settings/secret-delete-error.ts components/settings/secrets-delete-dialog.tsx components/settings/secrets-list-item-row.tsx components/settings/secrets-settings.tsx
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run i18n:check
CAPTURE_PR_ASSETS=true pnpm e2e:run --host --project chromium e2e/tests/settings/secrets-delete.spec.ts
CAPTURE_PR_ASSETS=true pnpm e2e:run --host --project mobile-chrome e2e/tests/settings/mobile-secrets-delete.spec.ts
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/secrets/service.go`, `handlers.go`, `delete.go`, and deletion tests/helpers.
- `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/main.go` and new reference checker/tests.
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/environment/environment.go` and tests.
- `apps/backend/internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle/environment_resolution.go` and tests.
- `docs/public/agents-and-profiles.md` and `docs/public/websocket-api.md`.
- `apps/web/components/settings/secrets-settings.tsx`, `secrets-delete-dialog.tsx`, `secrets-list-item-row.tsx`, `secret-delete-error.ts`, their tests, the secret API/types, and the settings locale catalogs.

## Dependencies

None.

## Risks

Cross-owner reference reads must fail closed. Internal store deletion remains available for lifecycle cleanup.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Issue #3500 and the linked requirements and system design.
- Existing scoped secret handlers and dynamic-profile conflict responses.

## Results

- `go test ./internal/secrets ./internal/agent/runtime/environment`: passed, 157 tests. Eight PostgreSQL tests were skipped because no test DSN was configured.
- `go test ./internal/backendapp -run TestSecretReference -count=1`: passed, nine tests. The integration test uses real encrypted SQLite storage and all three reference owners.
- `go test ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle -run 'TestSecretRecovery|TestResolveStrict' -count=1`: passed, three tests.
- The listed Vitest command passed all 24 tests. TypeScript, ESLint, and `i18n:check` passed.
- The managed Chromium and Pixel 5 E2E runs passed two tests each and produced validated desktop/mobile conflict-dialog captures. Long mixed-resource lists scroll independently while the explanation and Close action remain visible.
- `golangci-lint run ./... --new-from-rev=<PR-base> --timeout=5m` passed with no issues.
- Specification lint, public-documentation validation, and `git diff --check` passed.
- The existing desktop and mobile secret-deletion E2E specs now cover the preflight conflict dialog, verify its resource-card presentation and long-list scrolling, confirm that no destructive action remains, and retain the secret row.
- No live instance was changed or started. Temporary databases use test cleanup. Unrelated generated translation changes were removed.
- No agents were delegated. The issue assignment was verified. The implementation is committed in PR #3503.
