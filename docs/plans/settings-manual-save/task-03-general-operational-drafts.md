# Task 03: General and Operational Drafts

## Acceptance

- Former write-through General, Voice, Utility Agent, Feature Toggle, and changelog-notification controls remain local until Save.
- Theme preview is immediate but durable storage changes only on Save and discard restores the saved theme.
- Shortcut/feature/default resets are drafts; restart prompting follows a successful runtime-flag save.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- --run components/settings/terminal-settings.test.ts components/settings/keyboard-shortcuts-card.test.tsx components/settings/voice-mode-settings.test.tsx components/settings/system-metrics-settings-card.test.tsx components/settings/system/feature-toggles-settings.test.tsx
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck
```
