# Task 04: Existing Manual Editor Migration

## Acceptance

- Existing route-level Save controls register with the shared action and duplicate header/card/footer Save buttons are removed.
- Multi-card repository and nested profile forms keep independent dirty/error state while one Save covers all route contributors.
- SSH login-shell selection joins the executor-profile draft and no longer invokes profile persistence before the shared Save.
- New-resource routes and dialog/sheet Create, Save, and destructive actions retain their explicit local actions; only automation edit mode registers with the floating action.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- --run components/settings app/settings/agents app/settings/executors app/settings/workspace
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck
```

## Dependencies

Task 01.

## Inputs

- Spec: settings-wide coverage and overlay exceptions.
- Existing `SettingsPageTemplate`, `UnsavedSaveButton`, repository dirty helpers, and profile save helpers.

## Output Contract

Report migrated routes and intentional overlay exceptions, tests run, selector changes for E2E, files touched, blockers, and update task/plan status.

## Result

- Migrated workspace, repository, agent/profile, executor/profile, MCP policy, editor, notification, and automation edit forms to route contributors.
- Folded SSH login-shell and automation trigger edits into their owning drafts; trigger writes now begin only after Save and partial retries do not recreate completed triggers.
- Retained explicit Create actions for new agents, profiles, executors, and automations, plus overlay-local and destructive commands.
- Verified with 113 focused settings and automation tests, web typecheck, and scoped ESLint.
