# Task 19: Portable Azure Browse Preferences

## Acceptance

- Backend user settings expose and patch
  `azure_devops_browse_preferences`, keyed by workspace, without browser-storage
  hydration or persistence.
- Azure browse restores mode, scope, project/team/board/column, and work-item/PR
  filters only after settings load; rapid changes use queued writes and stale
  responses cannot overwrite the latest state.
- Missing/inaccessible remembered provider IDs fall back through the existing
  valid-child defaults while preserving other valid preferences.
- The SPA boot-state mapper includes `azureDevOpsBrowsePreferences` before
  marking user settings loaded, so a hard refresh restores the same project,
  team, board, focused column, mode, and filters as client-side navigation.
- Regression coverage serializes the boot payload shape and performs a browser
  reload after changing board selectors.

## Verification

- `go test ./internal/user/... -run AzureDevOpsBrowsePreferences` from `apps/backend`.
- `go test ./internal/backendapp -run TestMapUserSettingsStateIncludesAzureDevOpsBrowsePreferences` from `apps/backend`.
- `pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- --run lib/ssr/user-settings.test.ts hooks/domains/azure-devops/use-azure-devops-preferences.test.tsx hooks/domains/azure-devops/use-azure-devops-board.test.tsx` from `apps`.
- `pnpm e2e:run --host --no-build tests/integrations/azure-devops.spec.ts` from `apps/web`.

- `apps/backend/internal/user/service/service.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/user/store/sqlite.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/user/service/service_test.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/user/store/sqlite_test.go`
- `apps/web/lib/types/http-user-settings.ts`

- `apps/web/hooks/domains/azure-devops/use-azure-devops-preferences.ts`
- `apps/web/hooks/domains/azure-devops/use-azure-devops-preferences.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/hooks/domains/azure-devops/use-azure-devops-board.ts`
- `apps/web/app/azure-devops/azure-devops-page-client.tsx`

## Dependencies

None.

## Parallelism

Sequential. It spans the shared user-settings contract and Azure page state.

## Inputs

- Spec: Azure browse preferences data model and restore scenario.
- ADR 0041 backend-owned portable user settings.
- `apps/web/lib/user-settings-sync.ts` queued update pattern.

## Risks

- Preference hydration must not trigger default searches against a transient
  pre-hydration selection or persist a fallback before discovery settles.

## Output Contract

Report setting shape, fallback rules, RED/GREEN commands, files changed,
browser-storage audit, risks, and update task/plan status.

## Results (2026-07-31)

- RED: the boot-state mapper test showed a loaded payload with no
  `azureDevOpsBrowsePreferences`; desktop Playwright timed out looking for the
  remembered board selector.
- GREEN: the mapper test passes, the complete Azure Vitest slice passes (79
  tests), and desktop Playwright changes from Stories to Tasks, reloads, and
  restores Tasks and its board content.
- Preferences remain backend-owned user settings. No local-storage fallback was
  added; stale provider IDs continue through the existing discovery fallback.
