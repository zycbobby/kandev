# Task 05: Native Notifications and Duplicate Suppression

## Acceptance

- Desktop-owned launches emit native notifications for waiting-for-input and session-failure
  events when allowed by existing notification preferences.
- Each event identity produces at most one native notification; the browser Web Notification and
  backend shell-command System provider are suppressed only for the desktop-owned launch.
- Browser, CLI, and service notification behavior remains unchanged.
- Dock reopen and second-instance activation show/unminimize/focus the existing window without
  inferring a notification route.
- Permission denial keeps in-app indication/toasts and does not repeatedly prompt.

## Files Likely Touched

- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs`, `lib.rs`, and a native notification module
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and capabilities
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/backend.rs` for the desktop-owned launch marker
- `apps/backend/internal/notifications/service/` and provider tests
- `apps/web/lib/ws/handlers/notifications.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/ws/handlers/agent-session.ts`
- `apps/web/hooks/use-session-failure-toast.ts`
- New desktop notification bridge modules and focused tests

## Verification

```bash
rtk make -C apps/backend fmt
rtk make -C apps/backend test
cd apps/desktop/src-tauri && rtk cargo fmt --check && rtk cargo test --features desktop-runtime
cd apps/web && rtk pnpm test notification
cd apps/web && rtk pnpm run typecheck
```

Tests must cover event identity deduplication, desktop-only provider suppression, both event types,
preference-disabled behavior, focus without inferred routing, and permission denial.

## Platform Limitation

The Tauri notification plugin exposes desktop action callbacks, but Kandev does not register
actions because the generic notification body click has no portable task-route payload. Dock reopen
and second-instance activation therefore show, unminimize, and focus the existing main window
without consuming a task route. Generic focus and activation events never navigate.

## Output Contract

Update this task to `done` and check its plan item only after duplicate suppression is proved at
the desktop/backend/browser boundary.
