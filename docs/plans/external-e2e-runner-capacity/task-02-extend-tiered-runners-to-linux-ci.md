# Task 02: Extend Tiered Runners to Linux CI

## Summary

Apply the existing light and standard runner contract to eligible read-only
Linux jobs that can add merge-queue delay in the E2E, backend, and frontend
workflows. Keep checkout-token, report-token, host-service, container, Windows,
release, deployment, architecture-lint, action-pinning, and harness-lint
boundaries on GitHub-hosted runners.

## In scope

- Route the backend aggregate gate through the light tier. Keep backend jobs
  that check out source or publish reports on GitHub-hosted runners.
- Route frontend control jobs through the light tier and the frontend test job
  through the standard tier.
- Keep architecture-lint, action-pinning, and harness-lint checkout jobs on
  GitHub-hosted runners.
- Extend workflow contract tests to assert eligible and protected placement.
- Update the merge-queue runbook with the complete eligible-job table.

## Out of scope

- Percentage allocation. That is Task 03.
- Moving backend Postgres/service or Windows jobs.
- Moving Docker/Kind, Kubernetes compatibility, image, desktop, release,
  publishing, signing, deployment, or credential-bearing jobs.
- Changing test selection, matrices, artifacts, permissions, or required gates.

## Acceptance

- With burst mode inactive, every eligible job selects `ubuntu-latest`.
- With burst mode active and a non-empty tier label, eligible jobs select their
  light or standard label. Empty labels use `ubuntu-latest`.
- Protected jobs remain explicitly on `ubuntu-latest` and do not reference the
  burst or tier variables.
- Existing job names, dependencies, matrices, tests, artifacts, timeouts,
  permissions, and required conclusions remain unchanged.

## Dependencies

Task 01 must be complete so the shared variable names and E2E contract are
already established.

## Risks

- Container jobs can use an external VM only when the container workflow does
  not require host Docker or service containers. Protected jobs stay on
  GitHub-hosted runners until measured evidence exists.
- Short lint jobs can add planner or external capacity overhead if the fleet is
  unavailable. Manual burst rollback remains the recovery path.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Results

- Added planner-backed light and standard runner selection to eligible E2E,
  backend-gate, and frontend jobs.
- Kept E2E build/report, backend checkout/static/test-shard/ambient,
  architecture-lint, action-pinning, harness-lint, Postgres service, Windows,
  Docker/Kind, Kubernetes, image, desktop, release, deployment, and
  credential-bearing jobs on GitHub-hosted runners.
- Added workflow contract coverage for eligible jobs and protected boundaries.
- The renamed activation variable is `KANDEV_CI_EXTERNAL_ENABLED`.
- Contract, action-pinning, harness-lint, actionlint, specification, and diff
  checks passed.
