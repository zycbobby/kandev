# Task 05: GitLab Mention Provider

## Acceptance

- Issue and MR adapters use immutable object ID plus host scope and keep human IID/project details for display.
- Safe service methods construct title-search parameters without accepting raw GitLab filters.
- Search validates workspace-owned config/scope and never leaks install-wide results across workspaces.
- Provider authorizers fail closed unless the result host/project is proven to belong to the active workspace.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/gitlab/... ./internal/mentions/...
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/gitlab/service_mentions.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/gitlab/service_mentions_test.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/gitlab/store.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/mentions/provider_gitlab.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/mentions/provider_gitlab_test.go`

## Dependencies
