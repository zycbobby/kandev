# Task 02: Jira Mention Provider

## Acceptance

- Jira ticket projections preserve immutable upstream issue ID plus key/title/URL/site scope.
- Plain text becomes backend-generated, escaped key-or-title JQL; callers cannot inject raw JQL.
- Adapter enforces explicit workspace config and maps auth/rate/timeout/upstream failures safely.
- Provider authorizer accepts only the configured workspace site origin/scope for search and submission.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/jira/... ./internal/mentions/...
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/backend/internal/jira/models.go`
- `apps/backend/internal/jira/cloud_client.go`
