# Task 04: GitHub Mention Provider

## Acceptance

- Issue and PR search projections preserve immutable REST/node identity through PAT and `gh` paths.
- Plain text becomes backend-generated title-only GitHub search and respects workspace repository/org scope.
- Issue and PR groups remain separate, cached/scoped safely, bounded, cancellable, and safely classified.
- Provider authorizers validate the workspace-owned repository/organization scope and canonical GitHub host.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/github/... ./internal/mentions/...
```

## Files likely touched
