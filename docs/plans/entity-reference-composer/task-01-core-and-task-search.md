# Task 01: Core External Mention Search

## Acceptance

- Normalized provider service validates plain queries, runs bounded providers concurrently, and returns deterministic partial groups with safe statuses.
- Registry uses provider descriptors, owns provider identity/canonical ref construction, and accepts an arbitrary namespaced fake provider without native-provider switches, proving a future plugin bridge can use the same seam.
- Registry binds a unique `(provider, kind)` reference authorizer so search destinations and later submissions use the same provider-owned scope checks.
- HTTP handler implements the spec contract without central route registration yet.
- Kandev tasks are not registered in this provider registry because existing task discovery remains owned by `@`.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/mentions/...
```
