# Task 02: Update Storage Operations Documentation

## Summary

Update the public storage instructions for the new Storage destination.
Recapture screenshots that show the old `Data & Logs` breadcrumb.

## In scope

- Update storage paths and screenshot captions in `docs/public/operations.md`.
- Seed isolated disposable data for the storage examples.
- Recapture the four affected Storage screenshots.
- Check that the images show the Storage route and contain no private data.

## Out of scope

- Changes to storage behavior or API documentation.
- New public documentation pages.
- Changes to unrelated screenshots.

## Acceptance

- Public instructions direct operators to `Settings > System > Storage`.
- Every affected screenshot shows the Storage destination and safe demo data.
- Public documentation validation passes with no broken links or metadata.

## Verification

```bash
node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs
node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs
git diff --check -- docs/public docs/screenshots
```

Run these commands from the repository root.

## Files likely touched

- `docs/public/operations.md`
- `docs/screenshots/system-storage.png`
- `docs/screenshots/system-maintenance-policy.png`
- `docs/screenshots/system-quarantine.png`
- `docs/screenshots/system-docker-cleanup.png`

## Dependencies

- Task 01 must complete before screenshot capture.

## Risks

- A screenshot from a developer instance can expose local paths or task names.
- A crop can hide the new route title and fail to show the navigation change.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- The implemented Storage route from Task 01.
- The public operations how-to guide.
- The product demo seeding and capture procedures.

## Results

Implemented across commits `407e3df65` (the route split) and `97de44c48`
(the public documentation and screenshot refresh). Storage instructions and
captions now point to `Settings > System > Storage`. The four affected
screenshots were recaptured with an isolated Playwright fixture using fictional
`/var/lib/kandev/...` paths, then visually inspected and copied into
`docs/screenshots/`. The maintenance-policy and Docker-cleanup captures were
subsequently reframed so each visibly retains the Storage breadcrumb or page
heading alongside the relevant controls.

Verification passed:

- `node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs` passed all 61 tests.
- `node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs` validated 42 published pages.
- `git diff --check -- docs/public docs/screenshots` passed.

No landing-repository capture target was configured. The capture used the
isolated native Playwright fallback and did not include developer data.
