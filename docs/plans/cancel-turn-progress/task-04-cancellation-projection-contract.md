# Task 04: Cancellation projection contract

## Acceptance

- Full and summary task-session DTOs always serialize `cancellation_pending` and
  `cancellation_revision`, including explicit false/zero, from the narrow orchestrator provider
  without a repository/schema write.
- Task-detail boot state, task-session REST list/get responses, and the initial session-subscription
  snapshot expose the provider's current value, so a fresh client is correct before another live
  transition occurs.
- `task_session.cancellation_changed` maps to `session.cancellation_changed` and is delivered only
  to clients subscribed to that session; publishing failure cannot fail cancellation.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/task/dto ./internal/task/handlers ./internal/backendapp ./internal/gateway/websocket -run 'Cancellation|CancelPending|SessionDataProvider')
make -C apps/backend test
```

Follow TDD: add explicit-false DTO and fresh-load assertions first, then wire provider enrichment and
the session-scoped semantic notification until each boundary passes.

## Dependencies

Task 03.

## Parallelism

Sequential. It exposes Task 03's state and defines the contract Task 05 consumes.

## Inputs

- Spec: `API surface`, `Permissions`, `Failure modes`, and reload/second-client scenarios.
- Plan: `Session wire contract and routing` and `Boot, REST, and subscription reconciliation`.
- Existing patterns: `ForegroundActivityProvider`, `EnrichForegroundActivity`, task-handler provider
  discovery, `addTaskDetailSessionsState`, `buildSessionDataProvider`, and
  `TaskSessionActivityChanged` routing.

## Output contract

Report every contract shape and enrichment boundary, explicit-false and routing test evidence,
exact files/commands, blockers/risks, and synchronize this task plus `plan.md` in the same primary
conversation.

## Results

Implemented the runtime projection contract across DTO, REST, boot, subscription, and WebSocket
boundaries.

- `cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/task/dto ./internal/task/handlers ./internal/backendapp ./internal/gateway/websocket -count=1` — 685 passed.
- `cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/task/dto ./internal/task/handlers ./internal/backendapp ./internal/gateway/websocket -run 'Cancellation|CancelPending|SessionDataProvider|TaskEventBroadcaster_CancellationIsSessionScoped|AppendSessionStateMessage_IncludesCancellationPending' -count=1` — 11 passed.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

Full and summary DTOs serialize explicit `false`/`0`; task-detail/quick-chat boot state, REST list/get,
and the initial session subscription all enrich the atomic boolean/revision snapshot from the
orchestrator provider. Live transitions are session-scoped and publication errors are non-fatal. No
schema migration, durable marker, cross-workspace broadcast, or external side effect was added.
