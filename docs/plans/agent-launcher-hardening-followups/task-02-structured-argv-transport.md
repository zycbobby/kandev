# Task 02: Structured argv transport

## Acceptance

- Lifecycle stores and sends structured initial/continue argv end to end;
  agentctl executes it without reparsing display strings.
- `agent_args`/`continue_args` take strict precedence when present, while legacy
  `command`/`continue_command` remain absence-only compatibility fallbacks.
- Tests cover spaces, quotes, empty arguments, Windows paths/backslashes,
  prefix/CLI flags, initial, continue, reset/recovery, serialization, and
  legacy clients.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/agent/runtime/agentctl ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle ./internal/agentctl/server/api ./internal/agentctl/server/config ./internal/agentctl/server/process
```

## Inputs

- ADR structured-argv paragraph.
- Existing `agents.Command` token slices and lifecycle display-string builders.
- Current agentctl configure JSON and `config.ParseCommand` fallback.

## Output contract

Return a compact handoff capsule with intent/acceptance, base/head SHA, changed
files and entry points, ADR sections, risk tags, exact RED/GREEN verification
commands/results, uncertainties, and this task status set to `done`. Do not edit
