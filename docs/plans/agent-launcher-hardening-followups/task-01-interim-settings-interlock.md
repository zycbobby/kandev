# Task 01: Interim settings interlock

## Acceptance

- State-changing agent/settings routes reject a missing/wrong boot token and
  any bearer credential before handler side effects.
- Legitimate SPA requests attach the per-boot token and existing desktop/mobile
  settings saves continue to work.
- Tests and naming describe the control as a replayable interim interlock/CSRF
  token, never operator authentication.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/common/httpmw ./internal/agent/settings/handlers ./internal/backendapp
cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- --run src/boot-payload.test.ts lib/api
```
