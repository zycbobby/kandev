# Task 14: Runtime Registration Resolution

## Acceptance

1. App runtime clients are independently loaded, hot-added, invalidated, and resolved by
   registration ID/generation; no global active App or fallback remains.
2. Installation token cache, auth resolver, broker lease, principal, rate/singleflight keys include
   registration identity where required and preserve workspace/repository isolation.
3. Concurrent different registrations, intentional reuse, restart, and one-registration failure are
   covered without leaking root or personal secrets.

## Verification

```bash
rtk go test ./internal/github -run 'Test.*(AppAuth|AuthResolver|TokenCache|CredentialBroker|Registration)'
rtk go test ./internal/backendapp -run 'Test.*GitHub'
```

Run from `apps/backend`.
