# Task 07: Connection API, Health, And Mocks

## Inputs

- Spec: complete API Surface, Permissions, stable observable failures, and App capability status.
- Completed service, lifecycle, and broker contracts.
- Existing Gin controller/handler and E2E mock patterns.

## Acceptance

- Every specified status/configure/disconnect/start/callback/webhook endpoint is wired with mandatory
  workspace/current-user ownership, stable error codes, safe redirects, and no secret responses.
- The old token endpoint is a workspace-required, one-release deprecated alias; health reports
  workspace automation/personal capability state instead of one global boolean.
- E2E mocks independently model workspace principals, App permissions/expiry, callback state, and
  webhook transitions, and reset clears all new state.

## Verification

cd apps/backend && rtk go test ./internal/github -run 'TestHttp|TestMock'
cd apps/backend && rtk go test ./internal/health ./internal/backendapp -run 'Test.*GitHub'
```

## Output Contract

Report final route/request/response shapes, auth/redirect handling, compatibility headers, mock
controls, tests run, files touched, blockers, and risks.
