# Task 18: Workspace Authentication UX

## Acceptance

1. Workspace settings provide PAT, matched-height named CLI, known App selection, guided existing-App
   import, and guided manifest creation without segmented tabs or a System Settings detour.
2. Method guidance, private/public meaning, registration sharing, actor attribution, permission
   dialog, and conditional personal identity match the spec and expose no secrets after submission.
3. Component tests cover all source/states and the desktop/mobile layouts meet the 44px, one-scroll,
   wrapping, no-overlap contract.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/web && rtk pnpm run typecheck
cd apps && rtk pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- components/github/github-connection-dialog.test.tsx components/settings/system/github-app-settings.test.tsx
cd apps && rtk pnpm --filter @kandev/web lint
```

Rename/move the singleton settings tests to workspace component names as part of the task and run
their resulting paths if the old paths no longer exist.
