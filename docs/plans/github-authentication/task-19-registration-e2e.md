# Task 19: Registration E2E Coverage

## Acceptance

1. Playwright proves different Apps in two workspaces, intentional known-App reuse,
   create/import/install cancellation/failure, and personal cleanup on switch.
2. Old System Settings registration specs are removed or rewritten as workspace settings flows.
3. Desktop and mobile screenshots are inspected; horizontal overflow is zero and all auth actions
   remain usable with 44px targets and no overlap.

## Verification

```bash
cd apps/web && rtk pnpm e2e:run tests/integrations/github-authentication.spec.ts -- --project=chromium
cd apps/web && rtk pnpm e2e:run --no-build tests/integrations/mobile-github-auth-settings.spec.ts -- --project=mobile-chrome
```
