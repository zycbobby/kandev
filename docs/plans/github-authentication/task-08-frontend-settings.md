# Task 08: Workspace And Personal GitHub Settings

## Inputs

- Spec: What, Identity And Routing, state machines, failure modes, and desktop/mobile scenarios.
- Task 07 API contract.
- `apps/web/AGENTS.md` and the mobile-parity skill.

## Acceptance

- GitHub status/state is keyed by workspace and refetched on workspace changes without showing a
  previous workspace's actor, repositories, diagnostics, permissions, or rate limits.
- Settings expose feature-complete Workspace automation and My GitHub identity sections for legacy,
  PAT, named CLI, App installation, personal connect/reconnect, capability, and actor states.
- App-only `My GitHub` gating and user-triggered mutation attribution match the spec on desktop and
  mobile; all controls fit and remain keyboard/screen-reader accessible.
