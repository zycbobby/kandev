# Task 02: Bound and Stream Capture

## Summary

Bound the pre-capture persistence wait and stream chronological pages through
the existing IndexedDB schema. Use a monotonic relative budget and a small first
request so a slow link can return partial evidence.

## Failing regression first

Add these regressions before production changes:

1. In `runtime.test.ts`, hold one append and add later entries. Prove that the
   capture watermark does not move and that the one-second timeout selects the
   receipt-time memory snapshot.
2. In `indexeddb-store.test.ts`, seed two identities and equal timestamps. Prove
   exact chronological continuation without `getAll`, gaps, or duplicates.
3. In `capture.test.ts`, hold the second page. Prove that upload zero starts
   first and contains no more than 128 KiB of entry data.
4. In `capture.test.ts`, skew `Date.now()` and control `performance.now()`.
   Prove that the relative duration controls page admission and aborts an active
   upload.
5. In `service_test.go`, inspect the capture notification. Prove that it
   contains the absolute deadline and a nonnegative duration of at most 15,000
   milliseconds.

Run these tests and record their expected failures before implementation.

## In scope

- Add a monotonic sequence number to frontend staging entries.
- Make each drain request stop at its fixed sequence watermark.
- Save a bounded memory snapshot when capture starts.
- Wait one second for persistence through the capture watermark.
- If that wait expires, use the saved memory snapshot.
- Keep the active persistence drain and IndexedDB storage mode unchanged.
- Report memory storage and `flush_timeout: true` for the fallback capture.
- Page the existing `timestamp_ms` index with timestamp and primary-key
  continuation.
- Establish a persisted primary-key boundary at receipt before the capture
  flush, and retain exact primary keys for the receipt-prefix rows.
- Filter the requested identity without a complete-partition sort.
- Reuse prepared byte counts for page bounds.
- Add `capture_timeout_ms` to the backend WS notification.
- Use a monotonic local deadline and cancel an active upload at expiry.
- Use 128 KiB for the first page and 800 KiB for later pages.
- Remove `chunkEntries` and replace its direct unit test.
- Preserve empty final chunks, final metadata, and sequential chunk indexes.

## Out of scope

- IndexedDB version 3 or another write index.
- A change to the process-wide backend service lock.
- More retention, staging, profile, request, or collection capacity.
- Continuous upload, retry, new UI, or new user-facing copy.

## Acceptance

1. New entries cannot extend capture flush beyond its receipt watermark. A slow
   drain selects memory evidence within one second and continues persistence.
2. IndexedDB pages preserve identity and chronological order without a schema
   upgrade, a full `getAll`, gaps, or duplicates.
3. The first page uploads before later enumeration. The monotonic budget stops
   new work and cancels an active upload.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
(cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web exec vitest run lib/logger/buffer.test.ts lib/logger/indexeddb-store.test.ts lib/logger/runtime.test.ts lib/logger/capture.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec eslint lib/logger/buffer.ts lib/logger/buffer.test.ts lib/logger/indexeddb-store.ts lib/logger/indexeddb-store.test.ts lib/logger/runtime.ts lib/logger/runtime.test.ts lib/logger/capture.ts lib/logger/capture.test.ts)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
make -C apps/backend test
make -C apps/backend lint
```

## Dependencies

- Task 01 must record the complete phase table.
- Task 01 must show that backend locking does not require a separate repair.

## Dependency revision

Task 01 did not collect the required evidence, so this work order cannot claim
that the implementation addresses the confirmed root cause. The bounded
capture implementation remains in the branch as a mitigation based on the
available trace and isolated benchmark. Task 02 remains blocked until Task 01
records the phase tables and applies the backend gate.

## Risks

- Timestamp and primary-key continuation can skip equal-timestamp entries.
- A read transaction can scan entries for other identities before it fills a
  page. The global retention cap bounds this scan.
- The memory snapshot can contain less history than IndexedDB.
- The local budget can extend past backend expiry after transport delay.
- Abort support must pass through the shared API client without changing other
  requests.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- Task 01 results and any resulting plan correction.
- Platform diagnostic logging requirements and designs.
- Browser console retention requirements and design.
- Existing `fetchJson` abort-signal support.

## Results

- RED: the new tests failed before implementation. The eager capture prepared
  an oversized first request, IndexedDB used `getAll`, the drain included later
  entries, and the notification omitted the relative timeout.
- GREEN: capture now freezes the staging watermark, waits one second, and uses
  a receipt-time memory snapshot when the wait expires. Persistence continues.
- GREEN: the store starts a serialized receipt boundary before the prefix flush,
  passes the boundary key and exact prefix append keys to each page, and reads
  the timestamp index with `continuePrimaryKey()` for equal-timestamp
  continuation. It preserves identity filtering, equal-timestamp order, and
  global retention bounds while excluding writes that arrive between page
  transactions.
- GREEN: capture uploads a 128 KiB first page, waits for each upload before the
  next read, uses 800 KiB later pages, and aborts at the monotonic deadline.
- GREEN: the backend notification includes the absolute deadline and a capped
  relative duration.
- Verification passed: 4 frontend files and 45 focused tests, focused ESLint,
  web typecheck, 23 log-bundle tests, 23 log-bundle race tests, `gofmt -l`, and
  `git diff --check`.
- The repository-wide backend test target was run twice. Both runs failed in
  unrelated process-probe, configuration-discovery, launcher, and Office
  migration tests. The changed log-bundle package passed in both runs.
