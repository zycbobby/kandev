# Task 01: Floating loading-older overlay

## Context

`apps/web/components/task/prompt-history-panel-content.tsx` renders the
"Loading older messages..." indicator in-flow as the last child of the
scrollable `PanelRoot`, directly above the pagination sentinel
(`prompt-history-loading-older` / `prompt-history-sentinel`). Because the
panel's sentinel re-arms while intersecting, `isLoadingMore` flaps once per
page during auto-load; each in-flow mount/unmount of the indicator changes the
content height and the sentinel's geometry, producing visible flicker and
scroll jitter. The indicator must instead be a floating message at the bottom
of the panel, out of the content flow. See `plan.md` for the full root-cause
analysis.

## Acceptance

- The panel root is a positioned outer wrapper (`relative overflow-hidden`);
  the scrollable content lives in a distinct inner scroller
  (`data-testid="prompt-history-scroll"`, `h-full min-h-0 overflow-y-auto
  p-2`). The floating message anchors to the outer wrapper, so it never
  scrolls with the content (an absolutely positioned child of a scroll
  container moves with its content).
- The rows and the sentinel live in a content wrapper; scrollability is
  measured from the wrapper alone against the scroller's content box
  (`wrapper.scrollHeight > scroller.clientHeight - verticalPadding`, padding
  read from `getComputedStyle`; re-measured after every commit AND on external
  resize via a per-commit scroller ResizeObserver), so the indicator can never
  flip the mode and a width-only dockview drag cannot leave the mode stale.
- When the prompt rows overflow the panel (panel scrolls) and the loading
  message is shown, it renders as a floating overlay pinned to the bottom of
  the panel viewport: the indicator keeps `data-testid="prompt-history-loading-older"`
  and the `task:loadingOlderMessages` copy, is absolutely positioned within the
  outer wrapper (`absolute`, not in flow), is `pointer-events-none`, and sits
  above the rows (`z-10`).
- When the rows fit (panel does not scroll) and in the zero-entries branch
  (which can never scroll), the loading message is an in-flow row inside the
  scroller directly under the last message (after the sentinel), never
  floating.
- Flicker: the loading message stays mounted for a 400 ms grace window after a
  page settles, so consecutive auto-loads render one continuous indicator; it
  disappears once a settle is not followed by another load within the window
  or pagination ends. The grace is scoped to the active session: switching
  sessions within the window hides the indicator for the new session (it has no
  in-flight load of its own). With zero entries, the loading message shows
  instead of the neutral `task:loading` text or the empty state. Passthrough
  sessions remain an unconditional no-controls empty state.
- Shared lazy-load hooks gained OPT-IN behavior without changing defaults:
  `useLazyLoadMessages` accepts `minUserPromptsPerLoad` (the panel passes 10;
  the transcript stays single-page) and `useLazyLoadSentinel` accepts
  `stickToBottomWhileLoading` (the panel enables it; the transcript never
  sticks). The panel wiring lives in `usePanelOlderPromptSentinel` and the
  pin tracking in `useScrollPinnedToBottom`, with the sentinel observer/settle
  extracted into `useSentinelObserver`/`useSentinelSettle`. Existing sentinel
  and loading unit tests stay green unchanged; new tests cover the opt-in
  behaviors.

## Verification

Targeted unit suite (fails before the change, passes after):

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm vitest run components/task/prompt-history-panel-content.test.tsx
```

Add/extend regression tests in `prompt-history-panel-content.test.tsx`:

1. Mode test: with default geometry (content does not overflow), the loading
   element is in-flow (`py-2`, not `absolute`) and its parent is the inner
   scroller; stub the content wrapper's `scrollHeight` above the scroller's
   `clientHeight` (via the file's `setGeometry` helper, extended with
   `scrollHeight`) and rerender: the loading element carries the overlay
   contract (`absolute`, `pointer-events-none`, `z-10`), its parent is the
   panel root, and in both modes the sentinel's `previousElementSibling` is
   not the loading element.
2. Grace test (fake timers): after `isLoadingMore` settles, the loading
   element stays mounted through the 400 ms window and across a load that
   starts and settles within it; it disappears once the grace expires without
   a new load.
3. The zero-entries + `isLoadingMore` case keeps asserting the panel's
   `textContent` is exactly "Loading older messages..." with the sentinel
   present, and asserts the in-flow (non-floating) placement.

Global checks:

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint
```

E2E (user-facing flow):

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:raw -- e2e/tests/task/prompt-history-auto-load.spec.ts
cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:raw -- e2e/tests/task/mobile-prompt-history-panel.spec.ts
```

In `prompt-history-auto-load.spec.ts`, before releasing the held older-page
request, capture `scrollHeight` (and whether the panel scrolls); after
`prompt-history-loading-older` is visible, assert `scrollHeight` is unchanged
when the panel scrolls (the floating overlay must not alter content layout).
The existing "visible while held" assertion stays valid.

## Files Likely Touched

- `apps/web/components/task/prompt-history-panel-content.tsx` — outer
  wrapper + inner scroller split, floating/inline loading message, panel
  sentinel/pagination wiring.
- `apps/web/components/task/prompt-history-panel-content.test.tsx` — regression
  assertions above.
- `apps/web/hooks/use-lazy-load-messages.ts` + `use-lazy-load-messages.test.ts`
  — `minUserPromptsPerLoad` loop.
- `apps/web/hooks/use-lazy-load-sentinel.ts` + `use-lazy-load-sentinel.test.ts`
  — `stickToBottomWhileLoading`, extracted pin/observer/settle helpers.
- `apps/web/e2e/tests/task/prompt-history-auto-load.spec.ts` and
  `apps/web/e2e/tests/task/mobile-prompt-history-panel.spec.ts` — scroll the
  inner scroller; scrollHeight stability + absolute-placement assertions.

## Output Contract

Report the exact class strings used for the overlay and the panel root, the
unit assertions added, the e2e assertion added, and results of the targeted
vitest run, typecheck, lint, and e2e specs. Mark this task done in this file
and `plan.md`.
