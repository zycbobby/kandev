# Task 02: Toolbar action wiring

## Acceptance

- Changes/commit diffs, Review diffs, desktop Monaco file editing/preview, and the mobile file viewer expose the shared action whenever their file context resolves.
- File status, previous path, repository ID/name, session, and explicit PR-source revision flow through without cross-repository or cross-branch fallback.
- Existing toolbar actions, desktop density, mobile 44px reachability, and file/diff scroll ownership remain intact.

## Verification

```bash
(cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- components/diff/diff-header-toolbar.test.tsx components/review/review-diff-toolbar.test.tsx components/editors/external-vcs-file-link.test.tsx)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)
```

## Files likely touched

- `apps/web/components/diff/file-diff-viewer.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/diff/diff-viewer.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/diff/use-diff-options.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/diff/diff-header-toolbar.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/diff/diff-header-toolbar.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/review/review-diff-list.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/review/review-diff-toolbar.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/review/review-diff-toolbar.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/editors/monaco/monaco-editor-toolbar.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/task/mobile/mobile-file-viewer-panel.tsx`
- Focused component tests adjacent to the editor/mobile surfaces if existing coverage does not exercise the new control.

## Dependencies

- `01-link-foundation` complete.

## Inputs

- Spec: cross-surface, status/path, new-tab, accessibility, and mobile scenarios.
- Plan: `Toolbar integrations` and `Mobile design contract`.
- Patterns: existing `ToolbarBtn`/`ToolbarIconBtn`, `FileActionsDropdown`, `PanelHeaderBarSplit`, `MobileFileViewerPanel`, and `ReviewFile` identity fields.

## Output contract

Report summary, files changed, tests/commands with results, blockers, visual/mobile risks, and any divergence. Update only this task file's `status` to `in_progress` at start and `done` after acceptance and verification pass; do not edit `plan.md`.

## Completion report

- **Summary:** Wired the shared provider action into Pierre Changes/commit and Review diffs, Monaco editing, Markdown preview, and the dedicated mobile file viewer. File status, old path, repository, session, and published-branch context now reach the resolver without cross-repository fallback.
- **Changed scope:** Diff context/header wiring; Review file toolbar/context; Monaco, Markdown, and mobile file-viewer toolbars; adjacent component tests.
- **Focused verification:** `(cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- components/diff/diff-header-toolbar.test.tsx components/review/review-diff-toolbar.test.tsx components/editors/external-vcs-file-link.test.tsx)` passed with the adjacent toolbar coverage (32 tests total); `(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck)` passed; targeted ESLint and `git diff --check` also passed.
- **Risks/divergence:** Dense mobile headers retained a touch-sized action, but real-browser overflow/reachability remained the follow-up risk addressed by browser coverage.
