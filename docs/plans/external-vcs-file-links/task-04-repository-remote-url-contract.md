# Task 04: Repository remote URL HTTP contract

## Historical supersession

This task is superseded by [task 05](task-05-safe-remote-url-exposure.md). Security review rejected its proposed generic `remote_url` create/update write-through because that field is a clone target and must not become a broad user-controlled input.

There is no active acceptance, output, or verification contract for this task. Its safe read-only DTO portion continues through task 05: already-persisted `remote_url` is serialized for consumers, while generic repository create/update requests ignore submitted clone URLs. Provider/task resolution remains the trusted source of clone-target data.
