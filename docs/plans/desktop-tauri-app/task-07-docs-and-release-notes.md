# Task 07: Docs and Release Notes

## Acceptance

- User docs explain desktop install artifacts, runtime requirements, update expectations, and signing/trust status.
- User docs explain GUI-launch environment differences and what to do when an agent CLI is not discoverable from the desktop app.
- Engineering docs mention the `apps/desktop` package and release workflow ownership.
- The spec status and plan task statuses are reconciled with the implementation state.

## Verification

```bash
rtk git diff --check
rtk bash -lc 'cd apps && pnpm format:check'
```

## Files Likely Touched

- `docs/specs/desktop/requirements/desktop-tauri-app.md`
- `docs/plans/desktop-tauri-app/plan.md`
- `docs/desktop-tauri-signing.md`
- `docs/cli.md`
- `docs/features.md`
- `docs/remote-cloud-environment.md` if desktop build dependencies affect cloud dev setup
- `AGENTS.md`
- `apps/desktop/AGENTS.md`
- `apps/cli/README_internal.md`

## Dependencies
