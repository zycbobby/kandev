# Kandev Plugin API contract (native JS UI plugins — "option C")

This is the frozen interface every frontend + example task builds against. Do not
diverge without updating this file.

## Loading model

1. Backend boot payload gains `plugins: ActivePlugin[]` where
   `ActivePlugin = { id: string; name: string; bundleUrl: string; styleUrls?: string[];
repositoryProviderIds?: string[] }`. `repositoryProviderIds` is JSON
   `repositoryProviderIds`, copied from manifest `repository_providers`. It is optional
   only for additive compatibility with older boot payloads; a present empty list means
   the plugin declared no repository providers.
   `bundleUrl` = `/api/plugins/{id}/bundle` — kandev serves this **directly from the
   extracted package directory** on local disk
   (`~/.kandev/plugins/<id>/<version>/ui/...`, per manifest `ui.bundle`). There is no
   reverse proxy and no live upstream request: the plugin subprocess does not need to
   be running to serve the UI bundle, since installation already extracted the file.
2. On SPA boot, the **plugin host** (`apps/web/lib/plugins/host.ts`) iterates
   `bootPayload.plugins`, injects any `styleUrls` as `<link>`, and dynamically
   `import(/* @vite-ignore */ bundleUrl)` each bundle as a native ES module. Before a
   bundle can initialize, the loader supplies its `repositoryProviderIds` to the
   registry (for example `setDeclaredRepositoryProviderIds(pluginId, ids)`). The scoped
   registry then rejects `registerRepositoryProvider` or `registerReviewProvider` IDs
   outside that declared set. An omitted field preserves older-host compatibility;
   it does not invent provider ownership. Provider IDs are canonical lowercase
   identifiers: the manifest validator and frontend registry reject uppercase or
   otherwise non-canonical variants instead of creating case-dependent ownership.
3. Each bundle, when evaluated, calls the global:
   ```ts
   window.registerKandevPlugin(pluginId, {
     initialize(registry, host): void | Promise<void>,
     destroy?(): void,
   })
   ```
4. After the module resolves, the host calls `initialize(registry, host)`. A
   reload/update may unregister the previous generation before starting the next
   one; the host keeps that transition unresolved until the current generation's
   initialization finishes. Slow or failed reloads do not by themselves revoke
   open or saved task panels. On explicit plugin disable/uninstall the host calls
   `destroy?.()`, removes the plugin's registrations, and closes its panels.
   Each initialization attempt is transactional for plugin-owned runtime state:
   failure or timeout aborts plugin-owned work and fences callbacks from the
   expired generation. The same generation owns host-created subscriptions,
   modal and task-link handles, toasts, and review surfaces; the loader closes or
   unsubscribes them before calling `destroy` exactly once. Requests and callbacks
   from an expired generation cannot mutate the replacement generation. Failure or
   timeout does **not** unregister `registry` contributions (nav items, routes,
   etc.) already made before the failure — those persist, and only the plugin's
   lifecycle status becomes failed, until the plugin's _next_ load revokes them.

## Global entry point

`window.registerKandevPlugin(id: string, plugin: KandevPlugin)` — defined by the
host before any bundle loads. Bundles are authored with React as an **external**;
they must use `host.React` (NOT bundle their own React) to share the host instance.

The independently consumable frontend type contract is the runtime-free
`@kandev/plugin-sdk` package in `apps/packages/plugin-sdk`. Official plugins import
these types instead of re-declaring this document or importing `apps/web` internals.
The host has a compile-time assignability test, and the real Bitbucket package is a
required exact-head compatibility consumer.

For `host.api.invokeAction`, workspace-scoped actions accept only `workspaceId`;
repository-scoped actions accept `workspaceId` plus `repositoryId`; task-scoped
actions require `taskId`, may include a matching `workspaceId`, and may include
`repositoryId` only when that persisted repository is attached to the verified task.
A task action may also include `sessionId`; the host verifies it belongs to that task.
When both session and repository selectors are present, the host resolves the exact
non-empty worktree branch and exposes it only in the backend verified action context.
Resource selectors never become part of the untrusted action body.

An action handler may return an HTTP status from 200 through 599; zero preserves the
legacy 200 response. The host forwards only safe response headers (`Content-Type`,
`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Retry-After`). Invalid statuses become 502, while
transport/runtime errors become 503 without exposing internal error text. Plugins
should use explicit statuses only for safe domain outcomes that callers can act on.

`host.ui` contents: shadcn primitives (Accordion*, Alert*, Badge, Button,
Card*, Checkbox, Collapsible*, Dialog*, DropdownMenu*, Empty*, Input, Kbd,
KbdGroup, Label, Pagination*, Popover*, Progress, ScrollArea, Select*,
Separator, Sheet*, Skeleton, Spinner, Switch, Table*, Tabs*, Textarea,
Tooltip*, including `TooltipProvider`), the recharts wrappers (`ChartContainer`,
`ChartTooltip`, `ChartTooltipContent`, `ChartLegend`, `ChartLegendContent`,
`ChartStyle`), plus first-party app UI: `PageTopbar` (the kandev title bar, for
routes that opt out of the default chrome and own their layout),
`TaskCreateDialog` (kandev's real create-task modal, prefilled via
`initialValues`), `Combobox` (the app's Command+Popover picker), and the
provider-neutral code-host dashboard set: `ChangeRequestList`,
`ChangeRequestRow`, `ChangeRequestDetail`, `IntegrationListToolbar`, `IntegrationScopeBar`,
`IntegrationSaveQueryDialog`, `IntegrationRepositoryFilter`, `IntegrationCursorPagination`,
`IntegrationStartTaskMenu`, `IntegrationIcon`, `IntegrationChangeRequestStatus`, and
`TaskRowIndicator`, plus native integration settings surfaces:
`IntegrationAuthStatusBanner`, `IntegrationEnabledControl`, `SettingsSection`,
`SettingsCard`, and `WorkspaceScopedSection`. The authoritative list is
`apps/web/lib/plugins/host-api.ts` (`PLUGIN_UI`).

In create mode, `TaskCreateDialog` accepts this optional transport seam:

```ts
createTask?: (
  payload: Parameters<typeof createTask>[0],
) => Promise<CreateTaskResponse>;
```

When omitted, the dialog uses the normal `/api/v1/tasks` REST client. A trusted
plugin wrapper may provide it to send the unchanged native payload through
`Host Tasks.Create`; the same callback handles both the initial submission and
the one allowed fresh-branch re-consent retry. Edit and session modes ignore it.
The browser callback must not manufacture a repository-provider descriptor. It sends
only native task choices plus an idempotency identifier to an authenticated plugin
action; the plugin resolves repository identity from its live provider connection.
Scope idempotency to one open dialog so retry does not create duplicates while a later
intentional launch for the same change request still can.

Code-host plugins use that dashboard set as one contract. The plugin supplies
normalized change-request data, filter state, task presets, and callbacks; the
host owns row density, external-title behavior, responsive task menus,
linked-task navigation, and loading/error/empty treatment. A row's sole workflow CTA
is the shared **Task** preset menu, whose selection opens `TaskCreateDialog`
directly. Review belongs to the registered task review-provider surface, not a
parallel dashboard button or plugin-specific launch modal. `IntegrationIcon` maps
semantic names (`pull-request`, `pull-request-closed`, `merged`, `filter`) to the same
host Tabler glyphs used by first-party code-host pages; plugins do not copy their SVG
paths. Runtime components stay in the Kandev host and are versioned with `host.ui`.
A task preset may provide a semantic `iconName`; the host maps `eye`, `message`, and
`tool` to the exact first-party **Review**, **Address feedback**, and **Fix CI** icons.
`ReviewItemSummary.taskStatus` is the normal code-host status integration. Once a
registered review provider publishes it, Kandev automatically mounts the exact shared
topbar button, composer CI chip, desktop hover popover, and mobile drawer. Each rendered
linked-task row acquires one deduplicated provider refresh so its indicator color is live
before hover; hover/focus can refresh again, while active topbar/composer status refreshes
every 90 seconds. Plugins must not register
a visual slot or a second poller for these surfaces. Linked-task indicators also derive
the same semantic color hierarchy from normalized state, review, and pipeline fields;
providers do not send CSS classes or provider-specific color tokens. While the initial
task detail request is pending, the indicator remains muted; publishing the snapshot
updates both its summary and color. `IntegrationChangeRequestStatus` remains exposed for non-review-
provider composition only.

`ChangeRequestDetail` is the exact provider-neutral detail component consumed by
Kandev's GitHub panel. A review provider supplies its normalized model and advertised
callbacks; Kandev owns header, branches, state/review badges, description, review/check/
comment sections, add-to-context controls, scrolling, loading/error states, and native
mobile sizing. Code-host plugins must use it instead of recreating the review page.
A future SDK package may contain types or pure helpers, but not duplicate React/Radix
runtime components.
The curated surface also includes `RichTextEditor`/`RichTextReadOnly`, narrow
wrappers over the Plan panel's tiptap markdown editor (see below).

Plugins must use these host instances — bundling copies of anything
Radix/portal/context-based would split React context across instances and
break refs/`asChild`. Pure-React libs (e.g. `@tabler/icons-react`) bundle
fine.

### First-use repository inspection action

A manifest-owned repository provider that supports native task creation from a
new URL declares this workspace-scoped action:

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "repositories.inspect"
    scope: "workspace"
    max_body_bytes: 16384
```

The host invokes the active manifest owner from the backend. The plugin receives
the verified workspace context and this bounded body. Browser descriptor fields
are not forwarded:

```json
{"url":"https://code.example.com/owner/repository"}
```

Return the preferred nested response:

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "provider_id": "example-provider",
    "provider_host": "https://code.example.com",
    "provider_scope": "https://code.example.com/context-a",
    "provider_repository_id": "owner/repository",
    "owner_or_project": "owner",
    "name": "repository",
    "clone_url": "https://code.example.com/owner/repository.git",
    "default_branch": "main"
  }
}
```

The host accepts the descriptor at the top level for compatibility and accepts
`{"matched":false}` for a URL the provider does not own. A successful response
must use the requested provider ID and include a provider host, provider scope,
repository ID, owner or project, name, credential-free HTTPS clone URL, and
default branch. The clone origin must match the HTTPS provider origin. Provider
scope is limited to 512 bytes and identity fields cannot contain NUL bytes. Any
scope or repository ID hint from the task request must match the response.

The host enforces the manifest body limit, a 15-second timeout, and a 1 MiB
response limit. It validates the response before it writes a repository or task.
Malformed output is invalid, `matched:false` is not found, and provider or
transport failures are unavailable. Error responses do not include plugin body
content or upstream credentials.

### Persisted repository branch action

A manifest-owned repository provider that participates in Kandev's native task branch
picker declares this standardized action:

```yaml
actions:
  - key: "repositories.branches"
    scope: "workspace"
    max_body_bytes: 16384
```

Browser-invoked actions may additionally declare `access: "admin"`. Omitting
`access` preserves the default `authenticated` policy. The host rejects a
non-administrator before it forwards any request body to an admin action.

This action is invoked by the host backend, not the browser callback. Kandev resolves the
active plugin that owns the repository's persisted provider ID and supplies a verified
workspace context plus this snake-case body:

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "provider_id": "example-provider",
    "provider_host": "https://code.example.com",
    "provider_scope": "https://code.example.com/context-a",
    "provider_repository_id": "owner/repository",
    "owner_or_project": "owner",
    "name": "repository",
    "clone_url": "https://code.example.com/owner/repository.git",
    "default_branch": "main"
  }
}
```

Every field comes from the persisted workspace repository. The plugin returns
`{"branches":[{"name":"main","commit":"optional","is_default":true}]}`. Kandev
enforces the manifest request cap, a 15-second timeout, a 1 MiB response cap, at most
10,000 branches, non-empty names, and name deduplication. Missing ownership, an inactive
plugin, an undeclared/wrong-scope action, or malformed output fails closed. Providers
must not require browser-supplied repository authority on this path.

The host wraps plugin routes, slots, and `openModal` content in a
`TooltipProvider`, so a plain `Tooltip` works anywhere without one.
`TooltipProvider` is exported for plugins that want their own
`delayDuration`/`skipDelayDuration` over a dense cluster of tooltips; Radix
supports nesting it.

**Charts use the host's recharts.** `recharts` is already a dependency of both
`apps/web` and `@kandev/ui`, so the `Chart*` exports add no bundle weight — and
a plugin must never bundle its own copy. recharts drives layout through its own
React context and portals its tooltips, so a second copy splits that context
exactly the way a second Radix copy does: charts render at zero size, tooltips
attach to the wrong tree, and responsive containers stop resizing. Compose the
`Chart*` wrappers with the chart primitives they hand you rather than importing
`recharts` in plugin code.

### `host.toast` and `host.utils`

```ts
// Sonner's imperative toast — the host owns the single <Toaster/>, so there
// is nothing to render and it works from any plugin code path, modals
// included.
host.toast.success("Synced 12 issues");
host.toast.error("Sync failed");

interface PluginToastApi {
  (message: string, options?: Record<string, unknown>): string | number;
  success(message: string, options?: Record<string, unknown>): string | number;
  // Renders the same toast as any other variant, and additionally logs
  // `[plugins] toast.error from "<pluginId>":` to the browser console.
  // It does NOT file a report into kandev's frontend error log — that log is
  // for kandev's own application errors, and a plugin toasting an expected
  // condition (a failed poll, say) would otherwise record an Error-level
  // entry every cycle. Console is where every plugin failure surfaces.
  error(message: string, options?: Record<string, unknown>): string | number;
  warning(message: string, options?: Record<string, unknown>): string | number;
  info(message: string, options?: Record<string, unknown>): string | number;
  // Dismisses one toast by the id a variant returned, or all of them when
  // called with no argument.
  dismiss(id?: string | number): unknown;
}

interface PluginUtilsApi {
  // The host's clsx + tailwind-merge combiner, so class merging matches the
  // components it styles.
  cn(...inputs: unknown[]): string;
  // Non-security UUID with a fallback for supported insecure HTTP origins.
  generateUUID(): string;
  // Locale-aware relative time ("3 hours ago", "in 2 days", "yesterday") via
  // Intl.RelativeTimeFormat in the user's active locale; "" for unparseable
  // input. Prefer it over a hand-rolled ladder, which is English-only by
  // construction and goes untranslated for every non-English user.
  formatRelativeTime(value: string | number | Date): string;
  // Polling interval used by native integration health controls.
  integrationStatusRefreshMs: number;
}
```

These are functions, so they sit beside `navigate`/`openModal` rather than in
`ui`, which is a component map.

### Native integration settings state

`registerIntegrationSettings` may provide an `action` component. The host mounts
the action in the detail `SettingsSection` header and in the native integrations
index card. The host passes the routed `workspaceId` and a `surface` value of
`"detail"` or `"index"`. Use the workspace value for workspace-scoped reads and
writes. Do not use `getActiveWorkspaceId()` for a routed settings page.

`host.setIntegrationEnabled(integrationId, workspaceId, enabled)` publishes a
live value for one registration and workspace. The host checks that the
registration belongs to the current plugin. The value is not durable and is
cleared when the plugin unloads. Persist the source of truth with
`host.storage`, then republish it after load:

```ts
function publishAll(
  host: PluginHostApi,
  integrationId: string,
  enabledByWorkspace: Map<string, boolean>,
) {
  for (const workspaceId of host.context.getWorkspaceIds()) {
    host.setIntegrationEnabled(
      integrationId,
      workspaceId,
      enabledByWorkspace.get(workspaceId) === true,
    );
  }
}

const unsubscribe = host.context.subscribeWorkspaces((workspaceIds) => {
  // Load or refresh the durable value for the changed workspace ids.
});
```

`host.useSettingsSaveContributor` connects plugin drafts to the native save
bar. Contributor ids are local to the plugin because the host adds the
`plugin:<pluginId>:` namespace before registration. Save and discard remain
plugin-owned.

### `host.ui.RichTextEditor` / `host.ui.RichTextReadOnly`

Pixel-identical to the Plan panel's markdown editor (paste handling, slash
commands, drag handles, mermaid), so a plugin doesn't ship its own tiptap:

```ts
// RichTextEditor: editable, value/onChange round-trip markdown.
interface RichTextEditorProps {
  taskId: string; // required — scopes mermaid/image asset resolution
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
  className?: string;
  testId?: string;
}
// RichTextReadOnly: renders markdown read-only, no taskId dependency.
interface RichTextReadOnlyProps {
  value: string;

Deliberately narrow — not the plan editor's `comments`, `onSelectionChange`,
`onCommentClick`, `onCommentDeleted`, or `onEditorReady` props, so the plan
editor's internals can keep evolving without breaking this contract.

### `host.storage` — authenticated per-user key/value storage

Backed by `PUT/GET/DELETE /api/plugins/{id}/user-state/{scope}/{scopeId}/{key}`
and `GET /api/plugins/{id}/user-state/{scope}/{scopeId}` (list). Every
read/write is scoped to the calling user via the session/PAT identity — two
users writing the same `(scope, scopeId, key)` never see each other's value;
a `GET` for another user's key returns `404`. Requires the plugin manifest to
declare `capabilities.user_state: true` (`403` otherwise); an unknown or
disabled plugin returns `404`. `scopeId`/`key` must match
`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:-]{0,127}`; the request body is capped (`413` over
the limit — see `apps/backend/internal/plugins/user_state_handlers.go`'s
`maxUserStateBodyBytes`). `PUT` accepts an optional `ifUnmodifiedSince`
(compared against the stored row's `updatedAt`) — a conflicting write returns
`409` and leaves the stored value unchanged.

This is entirely separate from the plugin-owned `plugin_state` table (written
only by a plugin's own gRPC-connected backend via the Host `SetState` RPC) —
`host.storage` needs no plugin backend at all, so a UI-only plugin bundle can
persist data with zero Go code.

`host.storage.set` stamps a per-browser-tab `writerId` on every write (one id
per page load, shared across every plugin in that tab). A successful
`PUT`/`DELETE` publishes the `plugin.user-state.updated` WS action to the
writing user's own connections only:

```ts
// WS message: { action: "plugin.user-state.updated", payload: PluginUserStateUpdatedPayload }
interface PluginUserStateUpdatedPayload {
  pluginId: string;
  scope: PluginStorageScope;
  scopeId: string;
  key: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  writerId?: string;
  deleted?: boolean;
}
```

The payload carries keys only, never the stored value — a subscriber refetches
via `host.storage.get`. `host.storage.subscribe(...)` is a typed convenience
wrapper over `registry.registerWsHandler("plugin.user-state.updated", ...)`
that already filters to this plugin's own events, applies your `scope`/
`scopeId`/`key` filter, and skips notifications whose `writerId` matches this
tab's own writes (so an editor never clobbers its own caret/selection from its
own write).

  // "chat-top-bar" renders status in the session top bar (beside the

  // "main-top-bar" renders status/actions in the default app top bar on the

  // contributions join the horizontally scrollable middle action strip between
  // the fixed Kandev link and menu button. Documented host ui.Button icon
  // contributions are normalized to a 32px box with a 16px SVG icon on phones;
  // desktop contribution sizing is unchanged. It is the app-wide,

  // ids.
  // "sidebar-workspace-actions" renders icon buttons after the built-in Quick
  // Terminal and Quick Chat actions in the desktop sidebar's New Task row and

  // to "desktop" or "mobile". The mobile presentation must use a touch target
  // of at least 44px in its active dimension.
  // Resolving a session id to an agent/ACP transcript id (e.g. to key

The host treats `matchesURL` only as a coarse candidate filter. It runs every
remaining provider's cancellable, workspace-scoped `inspectURL`; `null` means the
configured provider does not own the URL. One structured result wins, more than one
is an ambiguity error, and registration order never decides ownership.

### App-status-bar slots

`app-status-bar-left` and `app-status-bar-right` are live named component slots.
Each registration is one opaque status item; the slot chooses its default side,
not a permanent side after user customization. Components receive
`slotProps` with this exact shape:

```ts
interface AppStatusBarSlotProps {
  placement: "left" | "right";
  presentation: "bar" | "mobile-drawer";
  density: "full" | "compact";
  pathname: string;
  activeWorkspaceId: string | null;
  activeTaskId: string | null;
  activeSessionId: string | null;
}
```

`placement` matches registration slot. `presentation` identifies the mounted host;
the host mounts only one presentation at once. `density` is `full` on desktop and
phone drawer, `compact` on tablet. `pathname` and active IDs are current-context
hints, not entity payloads. Use a typed `host.context` read or host-verified action;
do not inspect private store slices from a released plugin.

Before customization, registration order is render order within each default side.
Users can Cmd-drag on macOS or Ctrl-drag elsewhere with a mouse to move any item
across the whole desktop/tablet bar. Kandev stores that order in backend user
settings; disabled contributions keep their place and return there when enabled.
Phone renders the saved left sequence followed by the saved right sequence, without
dragging. There is no cross-plugin priority API, keyboard-arrow ordering, or touch
ordering. Enable, disable, and uninstall update slots without reload. Each component
is isolated by an owner-aware error boundary, so plugins must tolerate remounting and
render a compact bar control or touch-usable drawer row for the supplied presentation.
The host neither inspects nor separately reorders children inside a registration, and
does not add a nested interactive wrapper.

A full-bleed plugin route (`topbar: false`) opts out of host chrome. It may mount
the host-provided Status drawer trigger when its own chrome should expose status;
otherwise status access is intentionally its responsibility.

### Task panels

`registerTaskPanel` adds one row to the task workspace's "+" (add panel)
menu, after "Plan". Selecting it opens a dockview panel using a single
generic `"plugin-panel"` dockview component shared by every plugin panel —
panel identity lives in `params: { pluginId, panelKey }`, and the panel id is
`plugin:{pluginId}:{panelKey}`. This keeps the host's panel-rendering dispatch
to one branch per host release rather than one per plugin, and lets a saved
layout round-trip a plugin panel reference even when that plugin is no
longer installed: the layout manager drops (not throws on) an unresolvable
plugin panel, and `Settings > Layouts` renders a generic placeholder box for
one it can't render live.

Disabling or uninstalling a plugin closes any of its open panels in the
current session and removes its add-panel-menu row; a panel your Component
was actively rendering unmounts in place (no console error, no dockview
exception). A plugin `Component` that throws during render shows a small
"failed to load" fallback inside just that panel — the panel error boundary
is scoped to your panel only, not the surrounding dockview layout.

On a phone viewport, `mobileEnabled: true` adds the panel to one grouped
**Panels** bottom-nav action (after Terminal); it does not add one navigation item
per panel. The touch-sized `MobilePickerSheet` presents every available panel in
an internally scrolling list. Selecting a row dismisses the picker and renders
your `Component` as the single full-height mobile surface with
`presentation: "mobile"` — the same `Component`, no separate mobile
registration. During a slow or failed reload, the host preserves a selected panel;
after a ready generation, a panel omitted by the new registration is closed. An
explicit disable or uninstall closes every panel owned by the plugin.

### Kanban card contributions

With no plugin registered for group `"edit"`, the kanban card's context/
dropdown menu shows the same flat `Edit` item as today. Once any plugin
registers a `registerTaskMenuAction({ group: "edit", ... })`, that item
becomes an `Edit` submenu: `Edit task` (the original action) first, then each
visible plugin action in registration order. An action whose `visible(context)`
returns `false` is filtered out entirely (not shown disabled). Selecting an
action calls `run(context)`; a rejected promise is caught and logged to the
console, and the menu still closes either way (Radix's own close-on-select,
independent of the async result).

Group `"primary"` renders each visible action as its own flat, top-level menu
item instead of nesting it under `Edit`. It appears on cards and on the shared
desktop/mobile task-row menu. Group `"edit"` remains card-only. Visibility
filtering, registration order, and `run()`/error handling are identical; the
two groups are independent lists (an action only ever belongs to one).

`"task-card-indicators"` (documented above with the other slots) is the
matching read-only surface: a small icon/badge rendered beside the PR status
icon on every card, receiving `{ taskId, workspaceId, workflowStepId }`.

`"task-card-tags"` is a second, sibling read-only surface for the same
context — same `{ taskId, workspaceId, workflowStepId }` shape — but mounted
in its own row on the card instead of the cramped title row
`"task-card-indicators"` shares with `PRTaskIcon`. Use it for a contribution
that needs its own width, e.g. a row of tag chips.

`"task-row-metadata"` is a separate, plugin-agnostic slot for compact,
read-only metadata in the sidebar task tree and `/tasks` list. Its shape is
`{ taskId, workspaceId, workflowStepId, surface }`, with `surface` equal to
`"sidebar"` or `"task-list"`. The host emits no wrapper when the slot is empty.

### Task filters

`registerTaskFilter` adds one section to the kanban board's display dropdown
(the same menu that holds the built-in Workflow and Repository filters),
rendered below Repository and above the Preview Panel section. Each
registration's `getOptions()` supplies the section's checkbox list; the
plugin owns option identity, ordering, and labels — including any
"untagged"-style sentinel, which is just a normal option value the host does
not special-case.

Selections are multi-select and purely client-side against tasks already
loaded in the board's in-memory state: there is no backend query, pagination,
or persistence for this filter, and selections reset on reload (unlike
Workflow/Repository, which persist to backend user settings). An empty
selection is implicit "All" for that section — `matches()` is only invoked
once at least one option is selected, and multiple plugin filter sections
combine with AND (a task must match every section with an active selection),
mirroring how Workflow/Repository combine with the search query today. If
`matches()` throws, the task is treated as non-matching and the error is
logged (mirroring `TaskMenuActionRegistration.visible`'s error handling).

### Task-list facets

`registerTaskListFacet({ id, label, getValues, subscribe? })` adds a choice to `/tasks` Sort and
Group controls. `getValues({ taskId, workspaceId })` synchronously returns `{ value, label,
color? }[]`; `subscribe` invalidates the loaded page. Return each value at most once for a task,
and keep one label and color for a value across all tasks. Facet sorting uses the first value label
after a case-insensitive alphabetical comparison. Facets are page-local: no facet selection is
persisted or sent to the backend. The host catches callback errors and revokes registrations and
active subscriptions when the owning plugin unloads. A task with multiple values appears in each
matching group; a task without a value appears in the host's `Ungrouped` section. Parent/child
indentation is preserved only within a group both tasks match, so a matching child without its
parent is rendered at that group's root.

## Registry internals (host side)

`apps/web/lib/plugins/registry.ts` holds a singleton `PluginRegistry` whose data
is reactive (a small zustand store or event emitter) so host React components
re-render when registrations change. Every registration records the owning
`pluginId` so the host can bulk-unregister on disable. Exposes read selectors:
`getRoutes()` (each entry carries `pluginId` + `options`), `getNavItems()`,
`getSettingsRoutes()`, `getSlotComponents(slot)`, `getWsHandlers(action)`,
`getPluginName(pluginId)` (display name recorded by `forPlugin(id, name)`, used
for derived page-chrome titles), `getTaskPanels()` / `getTaskPanel(pluginId, id)`,
and `getTaskMenuActions(group?)`. `unregisterWsHandler(pluginId, action, handler)`
removes exactly one WS handler (used by `host.storage.subscribe`'s returned
unsubscribe) without disturbing the plugin's other registrations.

Before `initialize`, the loader records `ActivePlugin.repositoryProviderIds` for the
plugin ID. A present declaration is an allowlist for provider/review registration; an
absent declaration is tolerated only for older payload compatibility. Disable/unload
removes this declaration with the plugin's registrations. Failed/timed-out activation
performs the same cleanup and an attempt token prevents late async registrations from
reappearing.

Plugin top-level routes render inside `PluginPageFrame`
(`apps/web/components/plugins/plugin-page.tsx`): a `PageTopbar` title bar above
a scrollable content area, resolved from `options.topbar` with derived
defaults, or the bare component when the route opted out (`topbar: false`).

## Integration points the app must add (task-19)

- `src/spa-routes.tsx`: after the static route switch, before the not-found
  fallback, consult `registry.getRoutes()` for a matching path and render it inside
  the normal app shell.
- `src/settings-routes.tsx`: consult `registry.getSettingsRoutes()` for
  `/settings/plugins/{id}/*` paths.
- App sidebar (grep the nav list component): render `<PluginNavItems/>` reading
  `registry.getNavItems()`.
- `lib/ws/router.ts` / `lib/ws/client.ts`: after built-in dispatch, forward the
  message to any `registry.getWsHandlers(action)`.
- `components/plugins/plugin-slot.tsx`: `<PluginSlot name props/>` renders all
  slot components; drop into task detail sidebar + settings nav as initial hosts.
  The chat composer toolbar
  (`components/task/chat/chat-input-toolbar-desktop.tsx` and
  `-mobile.tsx`, via `chat-input-plugin-actions.tsx`) hosts the
  `chat-input-actions` slot for task and Quick Chat, passing the typed
  `PluginComposerSlotProps`. Task creation and new-session creation mount
  `task-create-input-actions` and `new-session-input-actions` with the same
  capability contract. `kanban-card-plugin-slots.tsx`
  hosts `task-card-indicators` beside `PRTaskIcon` and `task-card-tags` as its
  own row, both mounted from `kanban-card-content.tsx`'s `KanbanCardBody`.
- `components/task/dockview-shared.tsx` / `dockview-panel-content.tsx` /
  `dockview-desktop-layout.tsx`: the generic `"plugin-panel"` dockview
  component + `pluginPanelTab`, and `renderPanel`'s `"plugin-panel"` case
  resolving `{ pluginId, panelKey }` via `registry.getTaskPanel(...)`.
  `dockview-add-panel-items.tsx` renders one "+" menu row per
  `registry.getTaskPanels()`. `use-close-revoked-plugin-panels.ts` closes an
  open panel whose registration disappeared.
- `components/task/mobile/session-mobile-bottom-nav.tsx` /
  `plugin-panel-picker.tsx` / `session-mobile-layout.tsx`: expose all
  `mobileEnabled` registrations through one grouped Panels picker, and reconcile
  the focused panel against host lifecycle state; `MobilePanelArea` renders the
  selected `plugin:{pluginId}:{panelKey}` panel.
- `components/kanban-card-edit-submenu.tsx`: builds the card's `Edit` entry
  from `registry.getTaskMenuActions("edit")`.
- `lib/state/layout-manager/plugin-panels.ts`: `pluginPanelId`/
  `parsePluginPanelId` identity helpers plus registry-aware
  `isKnownPanelId`/`isStructuralComponent`/`resolvePluginPanelDefinition`,
  consulted by the layout manager's persistence/merge logic.
- `lib/plugins/host-api.ts` / `user-state-sync.ts`: `host.storage`
  implementation (fetch against the user-state routes, per-tab `writerId`)
  and `host.storage.subscribe` (over `registerWsHandler`).
- `internal/gateway/websocket/user_notifications.go` (backend): subscribes
  the `plugin.user-state.updated` bus event into the existing
  `UserEventBroadcaster` (user-scoped fan-out, same path as
  `user.settings.updated`).

## Security posture (documented, enforced where cheap)

Plugin JS runs in the kandev origin with store access — this is the accepted
tradeoff of option C. v1 mitigations: only **active, operator-installed** plugins
load; bundles are served by kandev from the extracted package directory (same-origin,
no third-party CDN, no upstream network hop); host wraps `initialize` in try/catch so
a broken plugin can't crash boot; failed/timed-out activation is rolled back; and
registrations are namespaced + bulk-revocable per plugin. No credentials are ever
displayed to the operator — installing a plugin (via
URL or upload) has nothing to copy or reveal, unlike the old register flow's one-time
API key/webhook secret. Sandboxing plugin JS (worker/realms) is explicit future work.

## Example plugin must (task-21)

Ship a bundle that on `initialize` registers: a nav item "Hello" → route
`/plugins/hello` rendering a native page (uses `host.jsx` + `host.ui`), a
`task-sidebar` slot component, and a WS handler for `task.created` that updates a
counter in its page via the plugin's own module state. No bundled React.
