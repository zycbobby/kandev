# Task 04: Lifecycle profile ownership

**Acceptance:** runtime uses the execution profile for CLI/provider, credentials/env, model, mode, config options, CLI flags and permissions, passthrough, and MCP; it uses the Office identity for instructions, skills, Office JWT/capabilities, budgets, ownership, and executor preference; Kandev-owned identity env cannot be overridden.

**TDD cases:** Codex identity with Claude execution profile launches Claude config only; execution-profile MCP/config options/passthrough/permissions apply; Office skills/instructions and capability claims remain; environment precedence protects `KANDEV_*`; non-Office launch remains unchanged.

**Likely files:** lifecycle launch/profile/environment/passthrough/MCP/skill deployment paths, executor Office preparation, Office runtime token/capability code, and integration tests around the assembled launch request and command.

**Verification:** focused lifecycle and executor tests, including real profile resolution through the settings repository.

**Dependencies:** Tasks 02 and 03.

**Output contract:** enumerate every field by owner, tests proving no cross-profile leakage, files changed, and residual runtime risks.
