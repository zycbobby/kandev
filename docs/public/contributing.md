# Contributing to Kandev

Kandev combines a Go server and native launcher, a Vite/React web client, a TypeScript development supervisor and npm shim, a Tauri desktop shell, and task-environment helpers. Begin at the subsystem that owns the behavior; do not recreate its rules in a neighboring layer.

## Quick path

1. Run `make bootstrap` once in a fresh checkout.
2. Use `make dev` for normal full-stack work.
3. Find the owning backend, web, CLI, desktop, or runtime boundary before editing.
4. Run focused checks, update public docs, and leave a small reviewable diff.

## Set up the repository

The pinned toolchain in `mise.toml` currently includes Node 24, pnpm 9.15.9, Go 1.26.0, and supporting tools.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev.git
cd kandev
make bootstrap
```

`make bootstrap` best-effort installs host prerequisites, installs the pinned tools, runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in `apps/`, and configures hooks. For browser E2E dependencies, use `make bootstrap-e2e`. Run `make doctor` to re-install the optional pre-commit and commit-message hooks.

## Run locally

```bash
make dev
```

This is the normal development path. The TypeScript supervisor starts the Go backend and Vite, selects available ports, points Go at Vite, and isolates application state under the checkout's `.kandev-dev/`. Use the printed URLs. Backend logs append to `.kandev-dev/logs/backend-logs.log`; startup prints the resolved path.

Automatic port selection only applies when no port was requested, and `KANDEV_BACKEND_PORT` or `KANDEV_PORT` in the environment counts as a request. An installed Kandev service that exported one therefore pins development mode to the port its own backend already occupies; the launcher rejects that request before readiness and never silently substitutes another requested port. Pass `PORT=` to override both the environment and the automatic choice, `WEB_PORT=` for the internal Vite port, and `DEV_ARGS=` for any other launcher flag.

```bash
make dev PORT=38430 WEB_PORT=37430
```

`make dev-web` starts only Vite on its fixed development port; it has no live API by itself. `make dev-backend` starts only the backend with the normal production-profile home unless you override it. For an intentionally isolated backend-only run:

```bash
KANDEV_HOME_DIR="$PWD/.kandev-dev" KANDEV_DEBUG_DEV_MODE=true make dev-backend
```

One backend owns a Kandev home at a time. Raw backend commands use the normal home by default, so a second backend with that home stops before it changes shared state. For an intentional second backend, use a separate `KANDEV_HOME_DIR`, database, and port.

Use `make build` for a production build. Use `make start` for a production-shaped local start; it installs dependencies, builds and synchronizes the embedded web application, then launches Kandev and writes `<resolved-home>/logs/backend-logs.log`. Use `make deploy` to publish that production build to the live user-domain daemon without mixing it with `make dev`; see [Run as a service](./run-as-a-service.md#run-a-source-checkout-as-a-service).

## Find the owner

| Change | Start here |
|---|---|
| Domain behavior, API, integration, or persistence | `apps/backend/internal/<domain>/` |
| Server construction and startup wiring | `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/` |
| Agent definitions, discovery, runtime, or executors | `apps/backend/internal/agent/` |
| agentctl binary and task-environment sidecar | `apps/backend/cmd/agentctl/`, `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/` |
| Browser routes, state, API calls, or UI | `apps/web/` |
| Shared web UI, types, or themes | `apps/packages/` |
| Development supervisor or npm runtime shim | `apps/cli/` |
| Installed native launcher behavior | `apps/backend/internal/launcher/` |
| Tauri process, updater, or native desktop boundary | `apps/desktop/` |
| Public documentation | `docs/public/` |
| CI, packaging, or release automation | `.github/workflows/`, `scripts/` |

Read the nearest types, tests, and startup registration before adding an abstraction. Backend domains do not all use one layout: follow the local handler/controller, service, repository/store, and provider pattern.

## Test while developing

Run the narrowest relevant package or workspace test during iteration. Before review, format first, then run:

```bash
make fmt
make typecheck
make test
make lint
```

`make test` covers Go, web, CLI, and repository-script tests. Browser Playwright, PostgreSQL, real-agent, container, and desktop-launch suites have separate prerequisites and commands; see [Testing](testing.md).

Repository policy requires every change under `apps/web/` to add or update a Playwright scenario in `apps/web/e2e/` and run `make test-e2e`.

## Keep public behavior current

Update `docs/public/**` in the same change when commands, configuration, settings, workflows, executors, integrations, APIs, screenshots, support status, or user terminology changes.

For a new page, create a stable Markdown slug with title and description frontmatter, add it once to `docs/public/meta.json`, link it from related pages, and run:

```bash
node --test scripts/validate-public-docs.test.mjs
node scripts/validate-public-docs.mjs
```

The complete source and Landing build contract is in the [public docs contribution guide](README.md).

## Review checklist

- The change has one clear user impact and owning subsystem.
- Wire changes update Go DTOs, TypeScript types/clients, compatibility behavior, and protocol docs together.
- Persistence changes include fresh-schema and upgrade-path tests.
- Credentials, external text, shell arguments, URLs, paths, and logs respect their trust boundary.
- Exact automated and manual checks are recorded; skipped suites have a reason.
- UI changes include Playwright coverage plus screenshots or a short recording.
- Generated artifacts, local databases, recordings, and unrelated formatting are absent.
- You understand and can explain all submitted code, including agent-generated code.
