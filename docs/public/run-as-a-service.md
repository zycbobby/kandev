# Run Kandev as a Service

The native Kandev launcher can install itself as a systemd service on Linux or a launchd service on macOS. Use this for a persistent workstation or server. Windows Service Control Manager, OpenRC, and SysV init are not supported.

For the simplest path, install Kandev persistently before creating the service; see [CLI installation](cli.md#install). A plain `npx -y kandev@...` launch is ephemeral, but `npx -y kandev@latest service install` can create a managed npx user service. That service depends on the cached npx package remaining present: reinstall it after upgrades, and expect npm cache cleanup to invalidate its recorded absolute paths. Prefer global npm for a durable service. Do not hand-write a long-lived service around an npx command.

Stable is the default release channel. A verified Kandev-managed npm/npx user service can opt into
the npm Nightly channel from **Settings → System → Updates**. Desktop, Homebrew, and system services
remain Stable-only.

> **Network security:** the backend listens on `0.0.0.0` by default and ships with authentication **disabled**. Before allowing remote access, enable [opt-in authentication](authentication.md) (the **Authentication & users** feature toggle, or `KANDEV_FEATURES_AUTH=true`) and terminate TLS in a reverse proxy; authentication does not replace HTTPS. A server bound to non-loopback interfaces without authentication logs a startup warning. See [server configuration](configuration.md#root-and-server).

## Quick path

1. Install Kandev persistently with the [CLI](cli.md#install).
2. Choose a user service for one workstation or `--system` for boot-time service operation.
3. Install, check `status`, and inspect `logs`.
4. Keep the listener private or protect it with TLS, authentication, and an access proxy.

## Choose a service mode

| | User service (default) | System service (`--system`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manager | `systemctl --user` or the user's launchd domain | system systemd or launchd domain |
| Privilege to install | Normal user | Root; normally invoke through `sudo` |
| Linux unit | `~/.config/systemd/user/kandev.service` | `/etc/systemd/system/kandev.service` |
| macOS plist | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kdlbs.kandev.plist` | `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.kdlbs.kandev.plist` |
| Default Kandev home | The installer process's `KANDEV_HOME_DIR` when set; otherwise `~/.kandev` | `/var/lib/kandev` |
| Process user | Current user | Existing Kandev-managed unit/plist account on reinstall; otherwise non-root `$SUDO_USER` when installed through `sudo`. A root login must choose `--run-as` explicitly. |
| Best fit | Personal workstation; single-user Linux host with lingering enabled | Boot-time service independent of a login session |

On Linux, an enabled user service starts at boot only if that user's systemd manager runs at boot. Enable lingering once if that is the desired lifecycle:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

Disable it later with `sudo loginctl disable-linger "$USER"`. A macOS LaunchAgent belongs to a logged-in GUI user; use a LaunchDaemon for a host-wide boot service.

## Install

### User service

```bash
kandev service install
kandev service status
kandev service logs
```

The installer writes the managed unit or plist and starts the process. It does **not** poll `/health`; use `status` and `logs` first. The logs print the actual listener URL because the launcher selects a free fallback port when `38429` is unavailable. Copy that URL and append `/health`; for example, if the log reports port `43127`:

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:43127/health
```

`/health` reports backend readiness after routes and the agent registry are initialized and the HTTP listener is accepting connections. It is not a deep health check of the database, message bus, executors, or remote providers.

### System service

The native installer does not create or change ownership of the system service home. Create it for the account that will run the service before installing. Select that account explicitly with `--run-as`:

```bash
KANDEV_BIN="$(command -v kandev)"
sudo install -d -o "$USER" -g "$(id -gn)" /var/lib/kandev /var/lib/kandev/logs
sudo "$KANDEV_BIN" service install --system --run-as "$USER"
sudo "$KANDEV_BIN" service status --system
```

Apply the same ownership rule to a custom `--home-dir`. Root access is also required to write the system unit/plist and control the system service manager. A root login must pass an explicit non-root account when that is the intended service identity.

The installer preserves the account from an existing Kandev-managed systemd unit or launchd plist
when you reinstall after an upgrade. It does not infer a new account from the shell that happens
to run the update. On a first install from a root login, supply the account explicitly:

```bash
sudo kandev service install --system --run-as brewuser --home-dir /var/lib/kandev
```

Use `--run-as root` only when a root service is intentional. `--run-as` is valid only with
`service install --system`; it cannot change a user service. Kandev checks that the system home
already exists, is not a symlink, and is owned by the selected account before replacing or
restarting the service. Missing or mismatched ownership fails with guidance; Kandev does not
recursively chown the data tree or add a broad Git `safe.directory` exception.

## Bind safely

The backend config loader searches `config.yaml` in its working directory,
then `<KANDEV_HOME_DIR>/config.yaml` (or `~/.kandev/config.yaml`), then
`/etc/kandev/config.yaml`. launchd sets the working directory to the Kandev
home; the generated systemd unit uses the selected home and carries the exact
selected file into the managed backend. Kandev uses only the first existing
candidate and does not merge files. For a shared conventional path, create
`/etc/kandev/config.yaml` before first start, or stop and restart after
changing it:

```yaml
server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
```

The working-directory file wins when both exist, followed by the home file and
then `/etc/kandev/config.yaml`. If the first existing file is unreadable or
invalid, startup fails instead of falling through. A home configuration file
cannot set `homeDir`. The service unit has an intentionally small fixed
environment and does not inherit arbitrary exports from the installing shell.
Put supported settings in the configuration file; see
[Configuration](configuration.md). A system service needs permission to read
the file, while secret-bearing configuration should use owner-only mode `0600`.

To access a loopback-only instance remotely, use SSH port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -L 38429:127.0.0.1:38429 user@server
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:38429` locally. For shared access, terminate TLS and enforce authentication in a reverse proxy or private access layer.

## Commands and flags

```text
kandev service install [--system] [--run-as <user>] [--port <port>] [--home-dir <path>] [--no-boot-start]
kandev service uninstall [--system]
kandev service start|stop|restart|status [--system]
kandev service logs [-f] [--system]
kandev service config [--system]
```

- `--system` selects the system manager and paths shown above.
- `--run-as <user>` is valid only for `service install --system`. Reinstalling without it preserves
  the account in the existing Kandev-managed unit/plist; on a first root-shell install it is
  required, including `--run-as root` when root is intentional.
- `--home-dir <path>` records `KANDEV_HOME_DIR` in the unit. For a user service with no flag, the installer first honors its own `KANDEV_HOME_DIR` environment, then falls back to `~/.kandev`; system mode defaults to `/var/lib/kandev`.
- On Linux, `--no-boot-start` starts the service now without enabling the unit, but it does not disable a unit that was already enabled. Disable it explicitly when necessary. On macOS the generated plist has `RunAtLoad=false` but also `KeepAlive=true`; the installer stores it in launchd's normal discovery path, bootstraps and enables it, then kick-starts it. That combination does not provide a dependable “never start at login/boot” guarantee; manage future loading explicitly with launchd if that distinction matters.
- `-f` or `--follow` follows logs.
- `--port <port>` is accepted by the installer, but the current native launcher writes it as `KANDEV_SERVER_PORT` and then replaces that value during startup. Do not rely on this flag to choose the listener. Without an explicit launcher port, Kandev tries `38429` and chooses a free random port in `10000–60000` if needed; find the actual URL in the logs. This is a current implementation limitation.

`config` is diagnostic but deliberately small: it prints the OS manager, selected user/system mode, Kandev home, and unit/plist path. It does not prove that the service is installed or active and does not print all unit environment entries.

### Fixed-port operator workaround

Until the native installer port mismatch is fixed, a systemd drop-in can set the launcher variable it actually reads. Run `systemctl --user edit kandev.service` and add:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=KANDEV_BACKEND_PORT=3000
```

Then reload and restart:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
kandev service restart
```

For a system service, use `sudo systemctl edit kandev.service`, `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo "$(command -v kandev)" service restart --system`. This is an OS-level override, not a Kandev installer flag; audit the drop-in during upgrades. The current launchd installer has no equivalent managed fixed-port option. A hand-managed plist must set `KANDEV_BACKEND_PORT`, and `kandev service install` will rewrite that plist.

## What installation changes

On Linux, installation writes the unit, runs `daemon-reload`, and normally runs `enable --now`. With `--no-boot-start`, it runs `start` without changing enablement; any prior enabled state remains. The generated service:

- executes the absolute native `kandev --headless` path;
- records `KANDEV_HOME_DIR`, `KANDEV_LOG_LEVEL=info`, a service `PATH`, the release bundle, and package version;
- uses `Restart=on-failure`, a five-second restart delay, `KillMode=mixed`, and a 30-second stop timeout;
- orders startup after `network-online.target`.

On macOS, installation writes the plist, removes an already loaded job, bootstraps the new plist, and enables it. Standard output and error go to `<KANDEV_HOME_DIR>/logs/service.out` and `service.err`. The plist always has `KeepAlive=true`; `--no-boot-start` changes only `RunAtLoad` and adds an immediate kick-start.

If the target unit/plist already exists and lacks Kandev's managed marker, installation saves it as `<path>.bak` before replacing it. Review that backup; uninstall does not restore or remove it.

The service manager starts the control plane only. Agents still need their configured executor dependencies and credentials, for example Docker access for a Docker profile or network reachability and keys for SSH. See [Executors](executors.md).

## Operate and inspect

```bash
kandev service start
kandev service stop
kandev service restart
kandev service status
kandev service logs          # last 200 lines
kandev service logs --follow
```

Add `--system` to every command for a system service and invoke it with sufficient privilege. Linux log commands use journald. macOS log commands tail the two files under the Kandev home computed by that invocation, rather than reading the installed plist. If installation used a custom home, repeat `--home-dir <path>` (or the same `KANDEV_HOME_DIR`) with `service logs`; also repeat it with `service config` if that diagnostic should print the installed home.

Useful direct checks are:

```bash
# User systemd service
systemctl --user status kandev.service
journalctl --user-unit kandev.service -n 200 --no-pager

# System systemd service
sudo systemctl status kandev.service
sudo journalctl -u kandev.service -n 200 --no-pager
```

## Upgrade safely

For a user service installed by `kandev service install`, use **Settings → System → Updates → Apply update** when a newer release is available. Kandev verifies the managed unit or plist and its owner-only `<home>/service/install.json` metadata before enabling this action. System services still require a terminal update because they need elevated privileges.

For a verified global npm user service, or an existing managed npx user service, the same page also
provides an install-wide **Stable** or **Nightly** choice. A global npm install is the recommended
durable service path. An npx-managed service is a recoverable but fragile fallback because its
executable lives in npm's transient cache. Stable reads signed GitHub Releases and remains selected
by default. Nightly reads npm's `kandev@nightly` tag and may contain unstable code from `main`. Select the row, use
**Save changes**, inspect the exact version, and then apply it separately. Apply submits that exact
immutable version; it does not re-resolve either mutable channel source. The backend accepts it
only while it still matches the selected channel's cached target. If that cache changes, Apply
returns a conflict and the page must refresh before you retry with the newly displayed target.

To leave Nightly, select Stable, save, and apply the displayed stable release. If the UI cannot do
that, use the manual stable recovery below. Homebrew, Desktop, system-service, unmanaged,
local-checkout, unknown, and invalid-metadata installs cannot select Nightly.

If the Apply action is unavailable or fails, use the recovery command that matches the original install. Repeat custom `--home-dir`, `--port`, and `--no-boot-start` values only on `service install`; `service restart` and `service status` accept `--system` but not those install-time flags.

```bash
# Global npm service
npm install --global kandev@latest
# Append original install-time flags here when used.
kandev service install
kandev service restart
kandev service status

# Existing managed npx service recovery only (run each service command through npx)
# This service points into npm's cache. Reinstall after upgrades; npm cache cleanup invalidates it.
# Prefer a global npm installation for a durable service.
# Append original install-time flags to service install when used.
npx -y kandev@latest service install
npx -y kandev@latest service restart
npx -y kandev@latest service status

# Homebrew service (Stable only)
brew upgrade kandev
# Append original install-time flags here when used.
kandev service install
kandev service restart
```

To remain on Nightly during a manual npm or npx recovery, use `kandev@nightly` in the matching command.
Do not use a Homebrew `HEAD` build as an equivalent channel; no Homebrew Nightly is published.

For system mode:

```bash
KANDEV_BIN="$(command -v kandev)"
sudo "$KANDEV_BIN" service install --system --home-dir /var/lib/kandev
sudo "$KANDEV_BIN" service restart --system
sudo "$KANDEV_BIN" service status --system
```

When reinstalling an existing system service, omit `--run-as` to preserve its recorded account, or
provide it only for an intentional account migration. Before an intentional migration, reconcile
the owner of `/var/lib/kandev` (or the custom home) yourself; the installer refuses to rewrite a
service whose data owner does not match the selected account.

Reinstalling an already active Linux unit performs `enable --now`, which does not guarantee a restart of that running process. The explicit `restart` is required to load the new executable. Back up persistent state before upgrades; see [SQLite backups](operations.md#sqlite-backups) or the PostgreSQL procedure under [Restore and recovery](operations.md#restore-and-recovery).

## Run a source checkout as a service

The repository Make targets build a release-style bundle and install that snapshot. They do not run live source files or the Vite development server.

Use `make deploy` to update the user-domain daemon you actually use. It builds the production SPA into the `kandev` binary, copies the runtime to `<live-home>/runtime` (typically `~/.kandev/runtime`), then reinstalls and restarts the user service. `make dev` stays isolated under `.kandev-dev` and does not replace that daemon.

```bash
make deploy
make service-status
make service-logs
```

`HOME_DIR=/path`, `PORT=...`, and `NO_BOOT_START=1` are the same optional overrides as `make service-install`. `make deploy` never installs a system (`--system`) unit.

`make service-install` still exists for a checkout-local install whose unit can execute `<checkout>/dist/kandev/bin/kandev`. Prefer `make deploy` when the live daemon must survive `make clean`, a branch switch, or a task worktree going away.

Available user-service targets include `service-start`, `service-stop`, `service-restart`, `service-logs-follow`, `service-config`, and `service-uninstall`. `make service-install-system` installs the built checkout as a system service. `PORT=...` is exposed by the Makefile but has the native-launcher limitation described above.

These source-checkout targets do not create service metadata for Settings-based update application.

## Uninstall and data cleanup

```bash
kandev service uninstall
# or
sudo "$(command -v kandev)" service uninstall --system
```

Uninstall stops/disables the job and removes the unit/plist. It leaves the Kandev home, database, repositories, logs, backups, and any `.bak` service definition intact. Remove those separately only after confirming the path and retaining any needed backup.

## Troubleshooting

### Service command is unsupported

`kandev service` supports only systemd on Linux and launchd on macOS. On Windows use a foreground process or a separately administered service wrapper; see [Windows support](windows-support.md). On a Linux distribution without systemd, write and own the init integration yourself.

### System service cannot create its database or logs

Check the process user in the unit and ownership of the full Kandev home path. The installer does not provision `/var/lib/kandev`:

```bash
sudo systemctl cat kandev.service
sudo namei -l /var/lib/kandev
```

Stop the service before correcting ownership, and grant access only to the intended service account.

### Git reports dubious ownership or origin setup exits with status 128

This means the Kandev service account and a managed checkout have different filesystem owners. It
is common after an upgrade if the service was reinstalled from a root login while the existing
checkout remained owned by the previous account. Check both sides before changing anything:

```bash
sudo systemctl cat kandev.service
sudo namei -l /var/lib/kandev/repos
sudo find /var/lib/kandev/repos -maxdepth 3 -type d -name .git -print
```

Reinstall without `--run-as` to preserve the existing service account, or deliberately reconcile the
home and checkout ownership before using an explicit `--run-as`. Do not fix this with
`safe.directory=*`; that hides the identity mismatch and weakens Git's ownership protection.

### Port 38429 is not the logged URL

The native launcher selects another free port when `38429` is unavailable. Check `kandev service logs` (or its `--system` form), stop the conflicting process if appropriate, and restart. The current installer `--port` value does not reliably control this selection.

### User service disappears after logout or reboot

On Linux, enable lingering and ensure the unit is enabled. A Linux install with `--no-boot-start` does not enable the unit, although it preserves a prior enabled state:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
systemctl --user enable kandev.service
```

On macOS, a LaunchAgent belongs to the user's login domain; choose system mode when the job must run without that user logged in.

### Service still runs the previous version

Reinstall using the upgraded `kandev` binary, preserve the original `--system` and `--home-dir` choices, and then run an explicit restart. Inspect `systemctl cat kandev.service` or the launchd plist if the recorded executable still points at an old package-manager path.

### Service starts but agents fail

Read service logs first. A service has a smaller `PATH` and no interactive shell environment, so tools or credentials visible in a terminal may be absent. Configure executor credentials through Kandev's profile/settings paths, use stable executable paths, and verify Docker/SSH/Sprites connectivity as described in [Executors](executors.md#troubleshooting).
