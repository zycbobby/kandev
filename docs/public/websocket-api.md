# Kandev WebSocket API

Kandev's web application uses one persistent WebSocket connection for most interactive requests and live notifications. This is an internal application protocol, not a versioned public SDK: action payloads can change with the backend and web client. For supported use, prefer the Kandev UI, CLI, MCP tools, and documented HTTP routes. Use this page when integrating a local client, reverse proxy, or diagnostic tool with the current implementation.

The normal local endpoint is:

```text
ws://localhost:38429/ws
```

Use `wss://` when the page is served over HTTPS. Workflow import/export, workflow sync, downloads, and several administrative operations remain HTTP APIs; a WebSocket action does not exist for every backend route.

The source of truth is the combination of:

- [`message.go`](../../apps/backend/pkg/websocket/message.go) for the envelope.
- [`actions.go`](../../apps/backend/pkg/websocket/actions.go) for names and standard error codes.
- Handler registration in [`gateway.go`](../../apps/backend/internal/backendapp/gateway.go) and each domain's `handlers` package for actions clients can actually request.
- The concrete request structs and validation in those handlers for payload fields.
- [`client.ts`](../../apps/web/lib/ws/client.ts) for the first-party web client's timeout, reconnect, and resubscription behavior.

An action constant alone is not evidence that an action is registered or emitted. The request catalog below was checked against non-test `RegisterFunc` calls and the gateway's special subscription dispatch, not just the constant list.

## Quick path

1. Prefer the UI, CLI, MCP tools, or documented HTTP routes for supported integrations.
2. If you need the WebSocket, connect to `/ws` and send one JSON request per frame.
3. Correlate responses by `id`, refetch after reconnects, and treat notifications as invalidation hints.
4. Protect the endpoint: it has no client authentication boundary.

## Security and network boundary

The current `/ws` upgrade handler does **not authenticate clients**. It reads `?token=` or the `Authorization` header but does not validate or use the value; JWT validation is still a code TODO. The default backend host is `0.0.0.0`, so a default process can listen on every interface even though examples use `localhost`.

The raw gateway rejects every action whose name starts with `mcp.` using a `FORBIDDEN` error before the shared dispatcher runs. This prevents raw clients from forging task or session identity that trusted MCP adapters inject; it is not user authentication. Internal MCP actions remain available through their mode-scoped MCP adapters and trusted in-process dispatch paths.

Treat every client that can reach the backend as fully trusted for the remaining WebSocket surface. Actions can create and delete data, start agents and shells, read and change files, run Git operations, reveal stored secrets, and invoke configured integrations. Do not expose port `38429` directly to an untrusted LAN or the internet. Bind to loopback, firewall the port, or put Kandev behind an authenticated reverse proxy that terminates TLS and restricts access. See [Configuration](configuration.md) and [Run as a Service](run-as-a-service.md).

The upgrade does enforce an origin policy for browser clients:

- A missing `Origin` header is accepted for non-browser clients. This is why origin checks are not authentication.
- A browser origin is accepted when its hostname exactly matches the request hostname; ports are intentionally ignored.
- Different loopback names or addresses are accepted when both origin and request hosts are loopback, such as `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` on different ports.
- Origins must be well-formed `http` or `https` origins with no path, query, fragment, or user information. Other cross-site origins are rejected.

When proxying, preserve a request host that matches the public page's origin and forward WebSocket upgrades. Do not rely on the ignored token parameter for access control.

## Wire envelope

Send one JSON object in each WebSocket text frame. The server writes each response or notification as one text frame. Its reader currently ignores whether an inbound frame was text or binary, but text JSON is the protocol contract.

### Request

| Field       | Type            | Current contract                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | string          | Required for a useful request. Generate a unique value and correlate the response or error with it. Notifications omit it.                                                                                                    |
| `type`      | string          | Send `request`. Server output uses `response`, `notification`, or `error`. The current dispatcher does not reject an inbound frame solely because `type` is missing or wrong, so do not treat it as an authorization control. |
| `action`    | string          | Exact registered action name; names are case-sensitive.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `payload`   | JSON            | Action-specific data. Most handlers expect an object and validate required fields themselves.                                                                                                                                 |
| `timestamp` | RFC 3339 string | Included by the server. Optional and ignored on client requests.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `metadata`  | object          | Optional string-to-string metadata used by selected internal flows. It is not a general request-header mechanism.                                                                                                             |

Malformed JSON produces a `BAD_REQUEST` error with empty `id` and `action`, because correlation fields could not be parsed. An unregistered action produces `UNKNOWN_ACTION`. Standard codes are `BAD_REQUEST`, `NOT_FOUND`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `CONFLICT`, and `UNKNOWN_ACTION`; individual handlers may add codes or return an ordinary response with `success:false` instead. Always inspect both envelope type and response payload.

## Transport, concurrency, and loss behavior

| Behavior                  | Current value                     | Client consequence                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maximum inbound message   | 32 MiB                            | A larger request closes/fails the connection. Current file-backed attachments use HTTP staging and send only descriptors over this socket; legacy inline base64 data still consumes the limit. |
| Write deadline            | 10 seconds                        | A peer that cannot accept a frame in time is disconnected.                                                                                                                                     |
| Pong deadline             | 60 seconds                        | The connection closes if the peer stops answering pings.                                                                                                                                       |
| Server ping interval      | 54 seconds                        | WebSocket libraries must process ping/pong control frames. Browsers do this automatically.                                                                                                     |
| Per-client outbound queue | 256 frames                        | When full, the new frame is dropped and the connection stays open. Responses and notifications can therefore be lost under backpressure.                                                       |
| Hub-wide broadcast queue  | 256 messages                      | Global publishers block when this internal queue is saturated; delivery to each client can still drop at that client's queue.                                                                  |
| Request dispatch          | One goroutine per inbound message | Handlers execute concurrently and responses can arrive out of request order. Correlate only by `id`.                                                                                           |

There is no sequence number, durable replay, acknowledgement, or exactly-once guarantee. Notifications are invalidation hints: after a reconnect, gap, or dropped frame, refetch authoritative state through the appropriate list/get request or HTTP route.

### Prompt attachments

The web client uploads prompt files with authenticated multipart HTTP at
`POST /api/v1/attachments` before sending `task.create`, `session.launch`,
`message.add`, or `message.queue.*`. Those WebSocket payloads carry an opaque
`attachment_id` plus `name`, `mime_type`, `type`, `delivery_mode`, and raw
`size_bytes`; they do not carry file bytes or host paths. A submission may
contain up to ten files and up to 100 MiB in raw bytes per file and in total.

Older clients may still send inline `data` descriptors during the compatibility
window, but they must stay within the existing lower inline-data validation and
the 32 MiB frame limit. Inline data is not a way to bypass the 100 MiB staged
upload contract.

Request handlers use the server hub's lifetime context, not the socket's lifetime. If a client disconnects after sending a mutation, Git command, or `session.launch`, that work normally continues until completion even though its response cannot reach the old socket. Do not blindly retry an uncertain mutation. First reconcile state with a get/list/status request; use application-level idempotency only where the specific handler provides it.

## Subscriptions and routing

Subscription actions are handled by the gateway before the normal dispatcher:

| Action                                                    | Payload                              | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task.subscribe` / `task.unsubscribe`                     | `{"task_id":"..."}`                  | Records or removes task interest. Current ordinary task/workflow lifecycle broadcasters are global, so this subscription is not a filter for `task.updated`.                                          |
| `session.subscribe` / `session.unsubscribe`               | `{"session_id":"..."}`               | Routes session-scoped traffic. Subscribe also pushes currently available initial session data, such as Git status.                                                                                    |
| `session.focus` / `session.unfocus`                       | `{"session_id":"..."}`               | Marks an actively viewed session, changes its backend polling tier, and on focus pushes fresh session data. Focused clients receive session-scoped traffic even during a transient subscribe handoff. |
| `user.subscribe` / `user.unsubscribe`                     | `{}` or `{"user_id":"default-user"}` | Empty uses Kandev's default user. Any other user is rejected with `FORBIDDEN`.                                                                                                                        |
| `run.subscribe` / `run.unsubscribe`                       | `{"run_id":"..."}`                   | Routes future `run.event.appended` messages for one Office run. No snapshot is replayed.                                                                                                              |
| `system.metrics.subscribe` / `system.metrics.unsubscribe` | `{}`                                 | Starts/stops delivery of live `system.metrics.updated` snapshots and contributes to metrics collection interest.                                                                                      |

All subscriptions are connection-local and are removed on disconnect. `session.subscribe` and `session.focus` can send an initial live snapshot, but other subscriptions do not replay missed notifications. For an Office run, fetch the REST snapshot before subscribing and reconcile again after a gap.

The first-party web client reconnects by default: at most 10 attempts, starting at 1 second, multiplying delay by 1.5, capped at 30 seconds. On open it flushes frames queued while disconnected, then resubscribes to tasks, sessions, focus state, runs, the default user, and metrics. Its ordinary request timeout defaults to 5 seconds; selected Git and PR requests use longer timeouts. A custom client must implement its own backoff, resubscription, refetch, and timeout policy.

## Core task and session requests

The typical product flow is workspace → workflow → task → session → messages. IDs are opaque strings; do not derive one resource ID from another.

### Create a task

`task.create` requires `workspace_id`, `workflow_id`, and `title`; the handler rejects an empty string, and first-party clients trim it. Normal clients also provide `workflow_step_id`. Optional fields include `description`, `priority`, `state`, `position`, `metadata`, `parent_id`, `plan_mode`, and `repositories`. Each repository entry must provide at least one of `repository_id`, `local_path`, or `github_url`; supported repository fields also include `base_branch`, `checkout_branch`, `pr_number`, `name`, and `default_branch`.

Set `start_agent:true` to start immediately; that requires `agent_profile_id`. `executor_id`, `executor_profile_id`, and `attachments` affect that initial launch. The response embeds the task and, when launch succeeds, adds `session_id` and `agent_execution_id`.

Creation and immediate launch are not one rollback boundary. If the task is created but agent launch fails, the request returns an error while the task can remain in the workspace. List tasks before retrying creation.

```json
{
  "id": "create-task-1",
  "type": "request",
  "action": "task.create",
  "payload": {
    "workspace_id": "workspace-uuid",
    "workflow_id": "workflow-uuid",
    "workflow_step_id": "step-uuid",
    "title": "Implement feature X",
    "description": "Implement it and add focused tests",
    "priority": "high",
    "repositories": [
      {
        "repository_id": "repository-uuid",
        "base_branch": "main"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Task states on the wire are `TODO`, `CREATED`, `SCHEDULING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `REVIEW`, `BLOCKED`, `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, and `CANCELLED`. Use `task.move` to change the workflow step and `task.state` to change runtime state; these are separate operations.

### Launch a session

`session.launch` always requires `task_id`. Explicit `intent` values are `prepare`, `start`, `start_created`, `resume`, `workflow_step`, and `restore_workspace`. Other fields are `session_id`, `agent_profile_id`, `executor_id`, `executor_profile_id`, `prompt`, `plan_mode`, `workflow_step_id`, `priority`, `launch_workspace`, `skip_message_record`, `auto_start`, and `attachments`.

If `intent` is omitted, the backend infers it from those fields. That inference exists for first-party compatibility; an external client should send an explicit intent so a later field change does not select a different path.

```json
{
  "id": "launch-session-1",
  "type": "request",
  "action": "session.launch",
  "payload": {
    "task_id": "task-uuid",
    "intent": "start",
    "agent_profile_id": "profile-uuid",
    "prompt": "Implement the task and run focused tests"
  }
}
```

A successful response contains `success`, `task_id`, `state`, and usually `session_id`; it can also contain `agent_execution_id`, `worktree_path`, and `worktree_branch`. Session states use uppercase values such as `CREATED`, `STARTING`, `RUNNING`, `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, and `CANCELLED`.

### Search work-item references over HTTP

The structured chat composer's `#` search calls `GET /api/v1/workspaces/:workspaceId/mentions/search?q=<plain-text>&limit=<per-source-limit>&exclude_task_id=<optional-task-id>`. `q` is required after trimming and accepts 1–200 Unicode characters. `limit` defaults to 5 and is clamped to 1–10. When supplied, `exclude_task_id` must belong to the requested workspace.

A successful response returns the normalized query and an ordered `groups` array. Each group includes `source`, `provider`, `kind`, `display_name`, `kind_label`, `status`, and `results`. One source can report `not_configured`, `unauthorized`, `rate_limited`, `timeout`, `upstream_error`, or `unsupported_scope` while the request remains HTTP 200 and other groups remain usable. Each result is a versioned `EntityReference` with the fields described below; raw provider errors and credentials are not returned.

### Send a user turn

`message.add` requires `task_id`, `session_id`, and either non-whitespace `content` or at least one attachment. Optional fields are `author_id`, `model`, `plan_mode`, `has_review_comments`, `attachments`, `context_files`, and `entity_references`.

```json
{
  "id": "message-1",
  "type": "request",
  "action": "message.add",
  "payload": {
    "task_id": "task-uuid",
    "session_id": "session-uuid",
    "content": "Also add regression coverage"
  }
}
```

`entity_references` is the structured companion to work-item Markdown links inserted by the `#` composer. Each version-1 entry carries `ref`, `provider`, `kind`, immutable `id`, optional display `key`, title snapshot, canonical `url`, and provider-connection `scope`. The backend derives the workspace from the persisted session, validates canonical identity and destination through the registered provider, deduplicates by `ref`, and rejects the request when a supplied reference is invalid or unauthorized. CLI-passthrough sessions do not accept structured references.

`message.queue.add` accepts the same optional array. `message.queue.update` also accepts it and treats the array as a replacement: send `[]` after removing every generated reference link so stale metadata is cleared. Queue status and message responses return validated entries under `metadata.entity_references`.

Ordinary `message.queue.add` admissions use the default-on automatic-merge setting. Capacity is enforced first. The newly admitted row folds only into its immediate pending predecessor when both rows have the same strict source and compatible task, model, plan mode, metadata, attachments, context files, and entity references; the merged context-file union is capped at 200 descriptors. Otherwise it remains separate. A successful fold returns the surviving earlier row's `entry_id`, while a fallback returns the new row's ID. The final state is published through `message.queue.status_changed`. Automatic merging applies only to later ordinary admissions, not existing rows, explicit append/coalesce/restore/retry/send-now operations, or the independent manual merge action.

`message.queue.merge` folds a queued entry into the entry directly above it. The payload requires `session_id` and `entry_id` (the source entry being merged away); `user_id` is optional and defaults to `user`. On success the response carries the surviving merged entry's `entry_id` (the target's id) and the server broadcasts an updated `message.queue.status_changed`. The request is rejected with `entry_not_found` when the entry was already drained or is not owned by the caller, with a validation error when no mergeable entry exists above it, and with `merge_reference_overflow` when the combined entity-reference lists would exceed the per-message cap (the merge is rejected atomically; neither row changes).

If the agent is busy, use the `message.queue.*` operations rather than retrying `message.add`. Permission prompts are represented in persisted/session message data; answer one with `permission.respond`. Its payload requires `session_id` and `pending_id`, plus `option_id` unless `cancelled:true`; optional `rejected:true` distinguishes an explicit denial from dismissing the prompt.

For a raw diagnostic session, install a WebSocket client such as `websocat`, connect, then paste one request object per line:

```bash
websocat ws://127.0.0.1:38429/ws
```

```json
{ "id": "health-1", "type": "request", "action": "health.check", "payload": {} }
```

`websocat` is a third-party diagnostic dependency, not bundled with Kandev. Remember that an originless tool is accepted only because the current endpoint trusts its network boundary.

## Registered request action catalog

The following 310 unique action names have concrete dispatcher registrations in the current backend. The 12 subscription/focus actions in the previous table are additional gateway-handled requests. Availability can still depend on a configured integration, handler mode, or service; registration does not supply credentials, provider installation, a running executor, or permission to external systems.

Payloads are not uniform. Read the corresponding handler request struct before building a non-first-party client. Names below are exact, including `vscode.openFile` and underscore-separated `user_shell.*` actions.

There are no ordinary dispatcher registrations for direct workflow-step update, delete, or reorder requests. Those operations are available through the workflow HTTP/configuration surfaces and relevant MCP tools.

### Sessions, messages, agents, and orchestration

```text

session.cumulative_diff
session.delete
session.ensure
session.file_review.get
session.file_review.reset
session.file_review.update

orchestrator.queue
orchestrator.status

permission.respond
```

`agent.launch`, `agent.stdin`, and related calls are lower-level agent controls. Task clients should normally use `session.launch`, `message.add`, and `session.stop`. Constants such as `agent.prompt`, `message.get`, and `session.set_mode` currently have no dispatcher registration and are deliberately absent.

`worktree.create_pr` is a provider-neutral compatibility action despite its name. For a successful GitLab remote it returns `success:true`, `provider:"gitlab"`, and the merge-request URL in `pr_url`; successful GitHub and Azure responses use the same URL field. See [Git Operations](git-operations.md#create-a-pull-request-or-merge-request) for provider detection, authentication, and partial-failure behavior.

`ssh.test` checks an SSH profile and `ssh.sessions.list` reads the backend's active SSH-session view; both are registered with literal action names rather than `actions.go` constants. `user_shell.stop` is a compatibility alias for destroy. Port-tunnel handlers require the tunnel service to be wired. Git semantics and destructive behavior are documented in [Git Operations](git-operations.md); executor-specific filesystem and credential boundaries are documented in [Executors](executors.md).

### Settings, secrets, and automations

```text

user.settings.update

secrets.create
secrets.delete
secrets.list
secrets.reveal
secrets.update

automation.create
automation.delete
automation.disable

automation.get

automation.runs.delete_all
automation.runs.list

automation.summaries
automation.summary
automation.trigger
automation.trigger.add
automation.trigger.delete
automation.trigger.update
automation.trigger_types
automation.update
automation.webhook.reveal_secret
```

These are trusted local-administration operations. In particular, `secrets.reveal` and `automation.webhook.reveal_secret` make the lack of WebSocket authentication security-critical.

`automation.run.stop` requires `automation_id` and `run_id`. It cancels the
selected open run's exact task/session/turn binding and returns `{run_id,
status}`. A stale or terminal binding returns not found; it never stops another
turn that happens to share the same task or session.

Automation payloads expose `task_mode` (`automation_run` or `normal_task`) and
`repository_mode` (`workspace_default`, `selected`, or `none`). Hidden runs may
omit workflow and repository data and use a Local scratch workspace. Normal
tasks require a workflow and remain visible in Kanban and the sidebar. A
repository-required provider trigger rejects `repository_mode=none` before it
creates an `AutomationRun`.

Provider actions make outbound calls with the backend's configured GitHub or GitLab identity. Status and registration do not imply a provider is authenticated, reachable, or authorized for a repository.

These registrations back Kandev's agent/MCP bridge. The subset registered in a process depends on its MCP handler mode and enabled capabilities. They are internal transport shims: raw `/ws` rejects every one of them before handler dispatch. Use the MCP tools exposed to the agent so tool schemas, task/session scoping, and compatibility handling remain intact. In particular, `mcp.stop_task` is the internal action behind task-mode `stop_task_kandev`; External MCP does not register that tool.

## Emitted notifications and recipients

The following catalog lists actions with current non-test emission paths. It intentionally excludes constants for which no active emitter was found, including the old `acp.*` compatibility constants, `permission.requested`, `input.requested`, `agent.updated`, and `office.activity.created`. Permission and clarification state currently arrives through session message records instead.

### Global broadcasts

Their normal live event path broadcasts to every connected client, which must filter by IDs in the payload. Session subscribe/focus hydration can also send selected state actions directly to the requesting client.

```text
workspace.created
workspace.updated
workspace.deleted
workflow.created
workflow.updated
workflow.deleted
workflow.step.created
workflow.step.updated
workflow.step.deleted
agent.profile.created
agent.profile.updated

agent.install.started
agent.install.output
agent.install.finished
github.task_pr.updated
github.task_ci_options.updated
github.rate_limit.updated
system.job.update
```

Current lifecycle code broadcasts `session.turn.started` and `session.turn.completed` globally even though their payloads identify a session. `task.subscribe` does not change this global routing.

`session.activity_changed` carries `task_id`, `session_id`,
`foreground_activity`, and `active_subagent_count`. The activity is
`generating` while the session is `RUNNING` and otherwise clears with the
coarse lifecycle by default; background-work accounting does not expose a
separate activity tier. When
`KANDEV_FEATURES_CLAUDE_BACKGROUND_PROMPT_HANDOFF=true`, a persisted Claude
Code session may instead expose `background` while its foreground has yielded
and adapter-attested async subagent, background shell, or Monitor work remains
active. Other providers remain coarse. The count is always an integer and is
zero when no adapter-attested subagent is live for that session. Task lifecycle
notifications expose the same count aggregated across the task's sessions as
`active_subagent_count`. Count-only changes may emit
`session.activity_changed` and `task.updated` even when the coarse lifecycle
state does not change.

Office workspace notifications are also global; clients filter on `workspace_id`:

```text
office.task.updated
office.task.created
office.task.moved
office.task.status_changed
office.task.decision_recorded
office.task.review_requested
office.comment.created
office.agent.completed
office.agent.failed
office.agent.updated
office.approval.created
office.approval.resolved
office.cost.recorded
office.run.queued
office.run.processed
office.routine.triggered
office.provider.health_changed
office.route_attempt.appended
office.routing.settings_updated
```

### Session-scoped broadcasts

Clients subscribed to or focused on the matching `session_id` receive:

```text
session.message.added
session.message.updated
session.message.deleted
session.agentctl_starting
session.agentctl_ready
session.agentctl_error
message.queue.status_changed
session.git.event
session.workspace.file.changes
session.shell.output
session.process.output
session.process.status
session.available_commands
session.mode_changed
session.agent_capabilities
session.models_updated
session.info_updated
session.todos_updated
session.prompt_usage
```

Semantic `session.message.added`, `session.message.updated`, and
`session.message.deleted` notifications can include `pending_action` with
`"clarification"`, `"permission"`, or explicit `null`. When present, it is the
authoritative per-session input projection after that message mutation and is
paired with `pending_action_revision` (`epoch` plus `sequence`). REST task-session
snapshots carry the same logical clock. Epoch is a decimal, database-backed backend
generation that increases across restarts; sequence increases within one generation.
Clients compare epoch numerically, then sequence. This keeps delayed snapshots from
an earlier generation from replacing current state when HTTP and WebSocket delivery
overlap, even after client state is rebuilt.
When both fields are absent, clients preserve their current projection and
reconcile through normal session refetch after a gap.

File changes are batched for up to 100 ms and flushed immediately at 50 entries. `session.shell.output` also represents shell exit events through its payload. Treat all stream messages as lossy and refresh session/Git status after a gap.

### User-, run-, and metrics-scoped broadcasts

| subscribed user     | `system.update_available`         | Local user notification for a newer Kandev release.

Routing is an efficiency mechanism, not an access-control boundary. The server does not authenticate resource ownership, global messages can contain IDs for other workspaces, and a client can request arbitrary subscription IDs.

## Reconnect and troubleshooting

- **Upgrade returns 403:** inspect the browser `Origin` and proxy `Host`. The hostnames must match exactly or both be loopback; ports may differ. A scheme other than `http`/`https` or an origin containing a path is rejected.
- **Connection works locally but is unsafe remotely:** this is expected with the current unauthenticated handler and `0.0.0.0` default. Add a protected proxy or bind/firewall the backend before allowing network access.
- **Request times out but the mutation happened:** the response may have been dropped or the socket may have closed while the server-side handler continued. Query current state before deciding whether to retry.
- **Notifications stop or state looks stale:** reconnect, resubscribe, and refetch. Check whether the client is consuming frames quickly enough to avoid the 256-frame drop-new queue.
- **Session stream is missing:** send `session.subscribe`; for an actively displayed session also send `session.focus`. Verify the payload's `session_id` matches exactly.
- **Unknown action:** confirm that the name appears in the registered catalog, not merely as a constant in `actions.go`, and check whether the required optional service was configured.
- **Large attachment disconnects:** keep the complete JSON frame under 32 MiB and obey the action's lower attachment-count and data-size validation too.
- **Responses arrive in the wrong order:** this is normal concurrent dispatch. Match by unique `id`, never arrival order.

Dedicated `/terminal/*target` and `/lsp/:sessionId` WebSockets, plus `/vscode/:sessionId/*path` and `/port-proxy/:sessionId/:port/*path` proxies, are separate protocols. They do not use this JSON envelope and should not be sent `/ws` actions.
