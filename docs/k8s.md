# Kubernetes Deployment Guide

This guide covers building the Kandev Docker image and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (for building the image)
- A container registry (Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR, etc.)
- A Kubernetes cluster with `kubectl` configured
- A StorageClass that supports `ReadWriteOnce` PVCs (for SQLite persistence)

## Building the Image

From the repository root:

```bash
# Build for your current architecture
docker build -t kandev:latest .

# Build for a specific architecture (e.g., for amd64 clusters)
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t kandev:latest .

# Multi-arch build (requires buildx)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t kandev:latest .
```

### Using the Pre-built Image

Kandev publishes images to GitHub Container Registry. Pull directly:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:latest
```

Or reference it in your K8s deployment:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:latest
```

### Choosing your image: vanilla vs. universal

Kandev publishes two flavors: the default vanilla image (smallest, npm-installable agent CLIs only) and a `:universal` image (~1.4 GB) that adds language toolchains (Go, Rust, build-essential), linters, and Playwright Chromium system libs - useful when your agents work on Go/Rust/Python projects or drive headless browsers.

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev:universal
```

See [`images.md`](images.md) for the full comparison, inclusion policy, and recipes for deriving your own image when you need something neither flavor includes.

## Deploying to Kubernetes

### Quick Start

```bash
# Apply all manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Check status
kubectl get pods -l app=kandev
kubectl logs -l app=kandev -f
```

### What Gets Created

| Resource | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Deployment | `deployment.yaml` | Single-replica pod running backend + web |
| Service | `service.yaml` | ClusterIP exposing port 38429 |
| ConfigMap | `configmap.yaml` | Non-sensitive environment configuration |
| PVC | `pvc.yaml` | 10Gi persistent volume for SQLite + worktrees |
| Ingress | `ingress.yaml` | Example ingress with WebSocket support |

### Accessing the UI

**Port-forward** (quickest for testing):

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/kandev 38429:38429
# Open http://localhost:38429
```

**Ingress**: Edit `k8s/ingress.yaml` to set your domain, then apply. The ingress routes all traffic to the backend on port 38429; the Go backend serves API, WebSocket, and SPA traffic on that port.

### Custom Domain / Reverse Proxy

No extra configuration is needed. The frontend automatically uses `window.location.origin` to reach the API, which works with any domain, reverse proxy, or ingress setup.

## Installing Agent CLIs

The kandev image ships with `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI), `node`, and `npm`, but **does not bundle the coding-agent CLIs** (`claude-code`, `codex`, `auggie`, etc.) — agent choice is per-user, and bundling all of them would bloat the image significantly.

> Looking to add tools *beyond* agent CLIs - language toolchains, build tools, internal CLIs? See [`images.md`](images.md) for the universal-image option and recipes for deriving your own image.

To install an agent inside the running pod, open **Settings → Agents** in the UI and click **Install** on the agent card under "Available to Install". The backend runs the agent's hard-coded install script (`npm install -g <pkg>`) and rescans on success.

The image sets `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/data/.npm-global` so user-installed npm globals land on the PV and **survive pod restarts and image upgrades**. The same persistence applies if you `kubectl exec` and install manually:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/kandev -- npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

After installing, log in with the agent's own auth (e.g. `claude login`), then click **Rescan** on the agents page.

### Persistent agent and selectable `gh` CLI auth

The image sets `HOME=/data/home` for the `kandev` user, so every CLI that writes its auth state under `$HOME` lands on the PV and survives pod restarts and image upgrades. This includes:

- `gh` CLI — `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`
- Claude Code — `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `~/.claude.json`
- Codex — `~/.codex/auth.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Auggie — `~/.augment/session.json`
- GitHub Copilot — `~/.copilot/...`
- OpenCode, Amp — `~/.config/<tool>/...`

So a one-time `kubectl exec -it deployment/kandev -- gh auth login` makes that named GitHub account available for workspace selection. Agent CLI logins such as `claude login` and `codex login` also persist, so you do not need to redo them after `kubectl set image` or a `helm upgrade`.

> Workspace PATs are stored in Kandev's encrypted secret store. A workspace configured for GitHub CLI resolves the exact selected host/login without changing the active CLI account. Host-active `gh`, backend `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`, and old globally named secrets are consulted only by migration-only **Legacy shared** connections.

Set `KANDEV_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_BROKER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the HTTPS Kandev service URL reachable from agent containers and remote executors. Set the stable secret `KANDEV_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_BROKER_REISSUE_SIGNING_KEY` to let a running executor recover its managed lease after a backend restart; changing this key invalidates outstanding execution capabilities. Drain or quiesce active agent sessions before key rotation. This is independent of GitHub App setup and is required for managed PAT or CLI credentials outside local/worktree execution. Ingress must pass `GET` and `POST` on `/api/v1/git/credentials/resolve` and `POST` on `/api/v1/git/credentials/reissue`; the older `/api/v1/github/credentials/*` paths remain compatibility aliases. Executors require the non-secret `GET` readiness response before startup, credential redemption uses the lease-authenticated `POST`, and reissue uses an execution-scoped capability.

## Configuration

Kandev reads configuration via `KANDEV_`-prefixed environment variables (Viper). Set these in `k8s/configmap.yaml` or as environment variables in the deployment.

### Core Settings

See [`configuration.md`](configuration.md) for the full reference (every backend knob and its YAML form). The tables below cover what's most commonly set in K8s manifests.

| Env Var | Required | Default | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KANDEV_SERVER_PORT` | No | `38429` | Server port (API + WebSocket + Web UI) |
| `KANDEV_HOME_DIR` | No | `/data` | Kandev home directory - contains `data/` (DB), `tasks/`, `worktrees/`, `repos/`, `sessions/`, and `lsp-servers/` |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_DRIVER` | No | `sqlite` | Database driver (`sqlite` or `postgres`) |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_PATH` | No | `$KANDEV_HOME_DIR/data/kandev.db` | SQLite database file path (override) |
| `KANDEV_DOCKER_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable Docker runtime for agents (requires DinD) |
| `KANDEV_LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_FORMAT` | No | auto | Log format: `json` (auto-detected in K8s) or `text` |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_OUTPUTPATH` | No | `stdout` | Log destination: `stdout`, `stderr`, or a file path (rotated when a file) |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_MAXSIZEMB` | No | `100` | Rotate the log file when it exceeds this size (MB). File output only. |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_MAXBACKUPS` | No | `5` | Max rotated files to retain (`0` = unlimited). File output only. |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_MAXAGEDAYS` | No | `30` | Max age of rotated files in days (`0` = unlimited). File output only. |
| `KANDEV_LOGGING_COMPRESS` | No | `true` | Gzip rotated files. File output only. |

> **Logging in K8s:** prefer the default `stdout` so kubelet collects logs. If you set `KANDEV_LOGGING_OUTPUTPATH` to a file, the active log is created with mode `0600` (owner read/write only); any sidecar reading it must run as the same user.

> **Upgrading from a pre-`KANDEV_HOME_DIR` deployment?** The SQLite DB path moved from `/data/kandev.db` to `/data/data/kandev.db`, and `KANDEV_DATA_DIR` is gone. Point `KANDEV_HOME_DIR` at the same volume mount (`/data`) instead. (`KANDEV_WORKTREE_BASEPATH` still works as an explicit override if you want to keep worktrees outside the home dir.) With no explicit database path, the backend checks the legacy `kandev.db` and, when valid, installs a validated snapshot at the current path while retaining the legacy database and its `-wal`/`-shm` files. Look for the `SQLite database selected` diagnostic with outcome `legacy_adopted`. If both candidates need operator review, startup stops and names both paths; preserve them and select the intended file with `KANDEV_DATABASE_PATH`. To keep the old path explicitly, set `KANDEV_DATABASE_PATH=/data/kandev.db` in the ConfigMap.

### PostgreSQL Settings (when `KANDEV_DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres`)

| Env Var | Required | Default | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_HOST` | No | `localhost` | PostgreSQL host |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_PORT` | No | `5432` | PostgreSQL port |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_USER` | Yes | `kandev` | Database user |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Usually | (empty) | Database password - required unless your Postgres allows passwordless auth |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_DBNAME` | Yes | `kandev` | Database name |
| `KANDEV_DATABASE_SSLMODE` | No | `disable` | SSL mode (`disable`, `require`, `verify-ca`, `verify-full`) |

## Database: SQLite vs PostgreSQL

### SQLite (default)

- Zero-config, works out of the box
- Database stored at `/data/data/kandev.db` on the PV (derived from `KANDEV_HOME_DIR=/data`)
- **Single replica only** (SQLite is single-writer)
- Deployment strategy is `Recreate` to prevent concurrent writes
- Good for small teams / personal use

### PostgreSQL (recommended for production)

- Supports multiple replicas for horizontal scaling
- Change deployment strategy to `RollingUpdate`
- Set via environment variables:

```yaml
# In configmap.yaml or a Secret
KANDEV_DATABASE_DRIVER: postgres
KANDEV_DATABASE_HOST: postgres.default.svc.cluster.local
KANDEV_DATABASE_PORT: "5432"
KANDEV_DATABASE_USER: kandev
KANDEV_DATABASE_PASSWORD: <from-secret>
KANDEV_DATABASE_DBNAME: kandev
```

When using Postgres, the PVC is still needed for worktree storage but the database itself is external.

## Persistent Storage

The PVC at `/data` stores:

- **SQLite database** (`/data/data/kandev.db`, `/data/data/kandev.db-wal`, `/data/data/kandev.db-shm`)
- **Git worktrees** (`/data/worktrees/`), **tasks** (`/data/tasks/`), **repos** (`/data/repos/`), **sessions** (`/data/sessions/`), and **LSP servers** (`/data/lsp-servers/`)
- **User home** (`/data/home/`) — `$HOME` for the in-pod `kandev` user; holds `gh` CLI auth and agent CLI auth state (see [Persistent agent and `gh` CLI auth](#persistent-agent-and-gh-cli-auth) above)
- **npm globals** (`/data/.npm-global/`) — agent CLIs installed via `npm install -g`

The PVC uses `ReadWriteOnce` access mode. If your cluster requires a specific StorageClass, add it to `k8s/pvc.yaml`:

```yaml
spec:
  storageClassName: your-storage-class
```

## Health Checks

The deployment's liveness probe calls `/health`; the readiness probe calls `/ready`:

- **Liveness probe**: Restarts the pod if the backend becomes unresponsive (30s interval, 3 failures). `/health` returns 200 as soon as the TCP listener accepts connections, before startup finishes.
- **Readiness probe**: Removes the pod from service during startup or issues (10s interval, 3 failures). `/ready` returns 503 until the real router is wired in and the pod can serve real traffic, then 200.

The CLI launcher performs the same two-stage check: it waits for `/health` (the backend process is alive) and then for `/ready` (startup finished, the backend can serve real requests) before starting the web server.

## Scaling

**Single replica (SQLite)**: The default configuration uses `replicas: 1` with `Recreate` strategy. This ensures only one instance writes to SQLite at a time.

**Multiple replicas (PostgreSQL)**: Switch to Postgres, change the deployment strategy to `RollingUpdate`, and increase replicas:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
```

## Upgrading

```bash
# Build and push new image
docker build -t your-registry.com/kandev:v1.1.0 .
docker push your-registry.com/kandev:v1.1.0

# Update deployment
kubectl set image deployment/kandev kandev=your-registry.com/kandev:v1.1.0

# Or edit the deployment directly
kubectl edit deployment kandev
```

SQLite migrations run automatically on startup — no manual migration step needed.

> **Upgrading across the `HOME=/data/home` change:** if you used `kubectl exec` to `gh auth login` or log in to agent CLIs on a pre-`HOME=/data/home` image, that state lived in the ephemeral `/home/kandev` and is not carried over. Log in once on the new pod and it will persist for all subsequent upgrades. If you want to keep the old state, copy it onto the PV before upgrading:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl exec deployment/kandev -- sh -c 'cp -a /home/kandev/. /data/home/ 2>/dev/null || true'
> ```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -l app=kandev

# View logs
kubectl logs -l app=kandev -f

# Shell into the pod (if needed)
kubectl exec -it deployment/kandev -- /bin/bash

# Check PVC status
kubectl get pvc kandev-data

# Describe pod for events
kubectl describe pod -l app=kandev
```
