# Children-Completed Wake Summaries Requirements

## Overview

When every direct child of a parent task reaches a terminal state, Kandev wakes
the parent's agent with a `task_children_completed` run. The wake prompt tells
the parent that its children finished. It does not tell the parent *which*
children finished, what state each ended in, what each concluded, or what each
produced.

The prompt has always had a section for exactly that. It renders only when the
assembled prompt context carries child summaries, and nothing has ever put them
there: the only code that populates them reads a `children` key out of the run
payload, and no producer writes that key. Three of the four producers assemble
child summaries — two paying a database read and a pull-request lookup — then
discard them at a boundary with no field to carry them. The result is a wake that
costs a full agent turn and begins with the parent knowing nothing about the work
it delegated.

This capability makes the children-completed wake name its children. It defines
what a child summary line reports, which children appear, in what order, and how
the prompt behaves when the underlying reads are unavailable.

Office owns this contract because the outcome is the content of an Office wake
prompt: what an autonomous agent is told when the Office scheduler launches it.
Adjacent contracts it reads but does not own are the task system's parent/child
relationship, task state, comments and archival, and the workflow engine's
`on_children_completed` trigger and its payload type.

This capability is constrained by
[parent wake wave identity](parent-wake-wave-identity.md), a sibling capability
that may not have merged yet, so its constraint is restated here rather than
delegated: **four producers can queue this run, at most one survives per
completion wave, no producer can observe which one won, and the surviving run
must deliver a wake equivalent to the one any other producer would have
delivered.** That is the link target's AC-OFFICE-WAKE-WAVE-IDENTITY-002.10, and
the link is a pointer, not a dependency a reader must resolve. Producer-specific
prompt content would make prompt quality a race outcome, so
REQ-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002 is the condition under which this capability
can ship at all.

## Prior art

**Wiki leg — receipt: not run, tool absent.** No `wiki-query` skill exists under
`~/.claude` or `/Users/neo/Projects/gstack`, `~/.obsidian-wiki` does not exist,
and `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` is unset, so there is no vault to pin with `@henry` and
no QMD collection to name. No grep fallback was substituted: a sweep over a vault
that is not present returns an empty result indistinguishable from a healthy miss.

**saas-kb leg — receipt: not run, server absent.** `~/.claude.json` `mcpServers`
is empty, the session's only MCP server is `kandev`, and no `search_fsm_docs`
tool is exposed. No `ai_sdlc` query was issued and no vendor comparison is claimed.

**In-repo prior art, which was available and was read.** The immediately
preceding capability,
[parent wake wave identity](parent-wake-wave-identity.md), took a position on
this exact defect while specifying something else. Its "Wake equivalence between
producers" section records that all four producers queue a **run row** payload
carrying no child summaries — three build summaries for the engine trigger, a
different payload that never reaches the row — and that "a change that starts
populating `children` from one producer must populate it from all four." This
capability adopts that position and satisfies it structurally, by removing the
per-producer payload as the carrier.

## Terminology

- **Children-completed wake:** the run the Office scheduler dispatches with
  reason `task_children_completed`, or the legacy reason `children_completed`,
  to wake a parent whose children have all reached a terminal state.
- **Producer:** any code path that can cause a children-completed run to be
  queued. Exactly four exist: `cascadeChildrenCompleted`
  (`office/scheduler/reactivity.go`), `queueChildrenCompletedRun`
  (`office/service/event_subscribers.go`), `ParentWakeReconciler.buildPayload`
  (`office/service/scheduler_wake_reconciler.go`), and `childCompletionPayload`
  (`orchestrator/event_handlers_children_completed.go`). The first queues a
  scheduler run context directly; the other three dispatch a workflow-engine
  trigger.
- **Prompt assembly time:** the moment the scheduler renders the wake prompt for
  a claimed run, immediately before launching the agent session. This is later
  than, and can be much later than, the moment the run was queued.
- **Live direct child:** a task whose parent is the woken parent task and whose
  `archived_at` is unset.
- **Child summary line:** one rendered line describing one live direct child.
- **Child list section:** the block of child summary lines, with its heading and
  any truncation notice, inside the wake prompt.

## Requirements

### REQ-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001: The wake names the children it is about

**Intent:** A parent woken to review delegated work must be told what that work
was and how it ended, in the wake itself, without spending a tool call to
discover the identity of its own children.

**User story:** As an autonomous parent agent, I want the wake that tells me my
children finished to also tell me which children and what they concluded, so
that my first action can be judgement rather than discovery.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.1:** When a children-completed wake
  prompt is assembled for a parent that exists at prompt assembly time and has at
  least one live direct child, the prompt shall contain a child list section
  holding one child summary line for each live direct child, subject to the
  display cap in AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.4. A parent that does not
  exist is governed by AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.3 instead, even when
  child rows still reference it.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.2:** Each child summary line shall report
  the child's task identifier, the child's title, and the child's task state.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.3:** When a child's most recent comment
  has a non-empty body, its line shall report that body.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.4:** When a child has no comments, or its
  most recent comment has an empty body, its line shall report no comment text
  and shall still report identifier, title, and state. The two cases shall render
  identically.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.5:** When a reported comment body is
  longer than the per-comment display limit, the line shall report the leading
  portion of that body followed by an explicit truncation marker. A body at or
  below the limit shall be reported without a marker. The limit shall be counted
  in Unicode code points, and a truncated body shall remain valid UTF-8.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.6:** A child summary line shall occupy
  exactly one line. A line break within any reported field, including the title
  and the comment body, shall not split it into two. Each reported field the task
  system does not itself bound shall have a display bound, so the section's total
  size is bounded by the line cap in AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.4.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.7:** When a child has one or more linked
  pull requests, its line shall report those pull request URLs up to a display
  cap, and shall indicate when the cap elided any. Which URLs survive the cap
  shall follow the ordering in AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.7.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.8:** When a child has no linked pull
  request, its line shall report no pull-request text, and its remaining fields
  shall be unaffected.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.9:** When a child has no task identifier,
  its line shall render a fixed placeholder in the identifier position and shall
  still report title and state.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.10:** When the parent has no live direct
  children at prompt assembly time, the prompt shall contain no child list
  section, no heading for it, and no truncation notice.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.12:** The child list section's heading
  shall not assert that the children it lists have completed. The lead-in
  sentence, which describes why the wake fired rather than the present state of
  the list, is unaffected. Without this, a child listed under
  AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.1a in a non-terminal state would appear
  under a heading contradicting the state reported on its own line.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.11:** The wake prompt's existing lead-in
  sentence and its existing closing instruction shall be present and unchanged in
  every case, including the empty case in
  AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.10 and the failure cases in
  REQ-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004. The lead-in reports the condition that
  fired the wake — every child had reached a terminal state when the run was
  queued — and not the present state of the list beneath it. A child that
  restarted between queue time and prompt assembly time therefore appears in a
  non-terminal state below a lead-in saying the children completed, which is
  required by AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.1a and is a defect in neither.

### REQ-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002: One rendering, whichever producer won

**Intent:** Four producers can queue this run, and exactly one wins a race none
of them can observe. If the prompt's content depended on which one won, the
parent's briefing would be a race outcome. The only way to guarantee equivalence
across four producers is to stop asking the producers for the content.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.1:** For a given parent and a given
  prompt assembly moment, the rendered child list section shall be byte-identical
  regardless of which producer queued the run.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.2:** The rendered child list section shall
  be derived from the parent's children as they are at prompt assembly time, and
  shall not be derived from any snapshot captured when the run was queued.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.3:** A `children` key present in a run
  payload shall not contribute to, suppress, or alter the rendered child list
  section. The same shall hold for a `truncated` key.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.4:** No producer shall be required to
  place child summary data, pull-request data, or a truncation flag into a run
  payload for the child list section to render.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.5:** No producer shall perform a database
  read whose only consumer is child summary data discarded before the run row is
  written.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.6:** The child list section shall render
  for both the current children-completed run reason and the legacy one.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.9:** Where a producer's decision to queue
  a children-completed run previously depended on a successful child-summary
  read, that dependency shall be removed. A child-summary read shall not be able
  to prevent a wake from being queued. The reads that establish readiness and
  wave identity are unaffected and shall keep gating dispatch exactly as they do
  today.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.7:** Runs of every other reason shall
  render exactly the prompt they render today. No other wake shall gain or lose
  content, and no other wake shall gain a database read.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.8:** A child summary line shall report the
  child's task state as the task system holds it. A producer-specific
  reinterpretation of that state, such as one producer's substitution of a
  completed state for a child occupying a terminal workflow step, shall not be
  reproduced at prompt assembly time, because it is not available to the other
  three producers and would violate
  AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.1.

### REQ-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003: Deterministic membership, order, and cap

**Intent:** The same parent in the same state must produce the same briefing
twice. Every axis that could decide otherwise — which children count, their
order, which comment is "the" comment, and what happens past the cap — is named
here rather than left to whichever row the database returns first.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.1:** The child list section shall include
  live direct children only. An archived child shall not appear in it.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.1a:** Membership shall not be filtered by
  task state. Every live direct child shall appear, including one that is no
  longer in a terminal state at prompt assembly time, so that a parent whose
  child restarted between queue time and assembly is shown that fact rather than
  a list silently missing a child.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.2:** Child summary lines shall be ordered
  ascending by the child's creation timestamp, tiebroken ascending by `tasks.id`.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.3:** A child's reported comment shall be
  its most recent comment by descending comment creation timestamp, tiebroken by
  descending comment id, regardless of the comment's author or author type.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.4:** The child list section shall contain
  at most 20 child summary lines. When the parent has more than 20 live direct
  children, the lines present shall be the first 20 under the ordering in
  AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.2.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.5:** When the parent's live direct child
  count exceeds 20, the child list section shall carry a truncation notice
  stating that the list is partial. When it does not exceed 20, the section shall
  carry no truncation notice.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.6:** The count that decides
  AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.5 shall count live direct children only.
  Archived children shall not be able to raise that count, so a truncation notice
  shall never appear while every live direct child is listed.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.7:** When a child has more than one linked
  pull request, its reported URLs shall be ordered ascending by URL string.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.8:** Two prompt assemblies for the same
  parent, with no intervening change to that parent's children, their titles,
  states, archival, comments, or pull-request links, shall produce byte-identical
  child list sections.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.9:** Membership, ordering, the cap, and
  the truncation decision shall behave identically on SQLite and on PostgreSQL.

### REQ-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004: The briefing never costs the wake

**Intent:** The child list is context, not the point. A parent whose children
finished must still be woken when the context is unavailable, and must be woken
with a prompt that is honestly short rather than one that is wrong.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.1:** When the read of the parent's
  children fails, the prompt shall render with no child list section, the run
  shall proceed to launch, and the failure shall not be reported to the agent as
  prompt content.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.2:** When the pull-request lookup fails or
  is not configured, every child summary line shall still render its identifier,
  title, state, and comment, without pull-request text, and the run shall proceed
  to launch.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.3:** When the parent task does not exist
  at prompt assembly time, the prompt shall render with no child list section and
  the run shall proceed to launch.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.3a:** When a children-completed run
  carries no parent task id, the prompt shall render with no child list section
  and the run shall proceed to launch.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.4:** No failure of a read performed for
  the child list section shall fail the run, change the run's status, or schedule
  a retry.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.5:** When a child's state, title,
  archival, comments, or pull-request links change between the moment the run is
  queued and prompt assembly time, the rendered section shall reflect the values
  at prompt assembly time.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.6:** When a run is retried or reassembled,
  the child list section shall be re-derived at each assembly rather than reused
  from the previous assembly.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.7:** When a child is written concurrently
  with prompt assembly, each read behind that child's line shall report either the
  child's pre-write or its post-write values, and assembly shall not fail. The
  guarantee is per read, not per line: a child's task fields and its pull-request
  links come from separate reads, so one line may pair pre-write task fields with
  post-write links. The section is a point-in-time reading and carries no
  atomicity guarantee across children or across those reads.
- **AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-004.8:** Prompt assembly for one
  children-completed run shall perform a bounded number of reads that does not
  grow with the number of live direct children.

## Out of scope

- **When a children-completed wake fires, and which children make a parent
  ready.** Readiness is the task system's
  [subtask completion trigger](../../tasks/requirements/subtask-completion-trigger.md)
  contract and the Office scheduler's existing readiness checks. This capability
  changes only what the resulting wake says.

- **The existing divergence in archived-child handling between readiness and
  membership.** Office readiness counts archived children as blocking; this
  capability's list excludes them (AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.1). They
  answer different questions deliberately: readiness asks whether anything is
  still running, the list describes the wave the parent must review. The
  consequence is bounded and named: a parent whose children are all archived and
  terminal can be woken with no child list section, which
  AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-001.10 defines as a valid rendering.

- **Wave identity, run deduplication, and backstop admission.** Owned by
  [parent wake wave identity](parent-wake-wave-identity.md). This capability
  depends on that one's producer-equivalence requirement and adds no identity of
  its own. In particular, the rendered content of the wake shall not be an input
  to any deduplication decision.

- **Removing `ChildSummaries` from the workflow engine's
  `on_children_completed` trigger payload type.**
  AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.5 stops Office producers paying for data that
  is discarded, but the field stays: deleting a field from a shared trigger payload
  changes the workflow engine's contract, with a different owner and blast radius.
  A future capability that removes it needs to know the field is written by three
  producers, read by none, and unreachable from workflow conditions, which reach
  the trigger payload only through a typed assertion for comment payloads.

- **Merging the two children-completed run reasons.** The legacy reason is
  rendered by AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-002.6 and is otherwise untouched.

- **The cross-parent coalescing behaviour of children-completed runs.** Two such
  runs for different parents addressed to the same agent within the coalescing
  window can merge, because this reason is not task-scoped for coalescing. That is
  pre-existing and is not worsened here — deriving content at assembly time from
  the surviving run's own parent makes the merged prompt self-consistent rather
  than less so.

- **User interface.** No control, view or setting is added. The output appears in
  two existing surfaces unchanged: the agent session's first message, and the
  assembled-prompt panel on the Office run detail page.

- **Changing which comment represents a child's conclusion.** This capability
  reports the most recent comment by any author
  (AC-OFFICE-WAKE-CHILD-SUMMARIES-003.3). Selecting a designated summary comment,
  or preferring an agent-authored one, is a different contract about what a
  child's conclusion *is*.
