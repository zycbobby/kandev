# Task Confirmation Surface System Design

## Purpose and boundaries

This design owns the presentation contract for the shared still-working warning,
the fine-pointer archive confirmation surface, and the cleanup consequence
hierarchy used by task archive and delete workflows. It also owns the explicit
discard choice for task worktrees. Task state and cleanup rules remain owned by
the task runtime contract.

## Components and responsibilities

- `apps/web/components/task/task-still-working-warning.tsx` remains the single
  markup and style owner.
- `TaskArchiveConfirmDialog` and `TaskDeleteConfirmDialog` render it inside the
  existing full confirmation dialog.
- `TaskArchiveConfirmation` routes the card-owned request to the existing
  dialog, desktop popover, or explicitly inline branch while reusing the same
  cleanup content and callbacks.
- Consumers continue to decide whether a warning mounts. The shared component
  does not inspect task state or alter callbacks.

### Task cleanup content model

`getCleanupSummary` and `getBulkCleanupSummary` remain the single place that
maps executor types to localized cleanup consequences. Their return value moves
from a flat `lines` array to structured effects and supporting notes. Effects
cover resources that are stopped, removed, or destroyed. Notes explain
unaffected repository scope or best-effort qualifications. The generic running
session effect remains present for every executor path.

The task subject sentence stays outside that model because archive and delete
describe different task outcomes. Single-task delete uses direct declarative
copy naming the task and its irreversibility. Archive uses corresponding
archive copy without describing archive as irreversible. Bulk strings retain
locale-aware count handling. Translations land together in the five real
catalogs: `en`, `pt-pt`, `zh-cn`, `zh-hk`, and `zh-tw`. The Traditional Chinese
catalogs are generated through the repository's `i18n:zh-hant` workflow. The
QA-only `pseudo` locale remains hidden in production, must stay synchronized
with `en` under `i18n:check`, and is regenerated with `pnpm run i18n:pseudo`.

A shared task-local renderer presents effects as a semantic list and notes as
supporting prose. Full dialogs use paragraphs and a list. The existing compact
archive popover and inline confirmation use the same ordered model with their
established compact spacing. This removes copy drift without moving cleanup
policy into a visual component.

### Full-dialog composition

`TaskArchiveConfirmDialog` and `TaskDeleteConfirmDialog` keep Radix
`AlertDialog` and the existing centered inset surface. The current `size="lg"`
phone width remains because prose benefits from the available line length and
the primitive already preserves 16px viewport insets.

`TaskDeleteConfirmDialog` shows an unchecked discard selection when the delete
can remove a worktree. This includes a worktree executor, a bulk selection with
a worktree executor, or a cascade that can include child worktrees. The label
states that tracked and untracked files will be permanently removed. The delete
action remains disabled until the user selects this outcome. When the task's
executor projection is absent, the dialog fails closed and shows the same
choice because a retained task-owned worktree may outlive its last session.

Each full surface uses an auto/minmax/auto layout: title in the first row, one
`minmax(0, 1fr)` body containing description, cleanup consequences, warning,
and cascade choice, then the persistent action footer. The surface is capped by
the dynamic viewport; the body owns vertical overflow. Short confirmations
retain intrinsic height, while long task names, bulk executor groups, longer
locales, warnings, and cascade copy remain reachable.

Both footer actions use `min-h-11 w-full` below `sm`, restoring compact
automatic dimensions at `sm`. Delete selects `variant="destructive"` on
`AlertDialogAction` and removes manual color utilities. This matters because
the action is slotted through `Button`: a default wrapper currently contributes
`bg-primary` while the child contributes `bg-destructive`, and stylesheet order
allows the primary color to win. Archive continues to use the default action
variant.

### Compact archive surfaces

`TaskArchiveConfirmation` consumes the same structured cleanup model for its
fine-pointer popover and coarse-pointer inline confirmation. It keeps the
existing `ActionConfirmPopover` and `InlineConfirmActions` components, widths,
touch density, callbacks, and focus-return behavior. Only the internal copy
hierarchy changes: direct archive outcome, ordered effects, then supporting
notes and the existing still-working warning.

### Source-specific archive routing

Archive presentation is selected by the source surface, not by coarse-pointer
classification alone. The mobile Kanban card opts into the existing full
`TaskArchiveConfirmDialog` through `TaskArchiveConfirmation`'s internal
`forceDialog` presentation prop. This keeps the confirmation portaled over the
board, so a virtualized card row does not grow when a zero-descendant task is
being archived.

Fine-pointer desktop and compact-desktop Kanban retain the anchored
`ActionConfirmPopover`. Coarse-pointer tablet Kanban retains its existing
coarse-pointer routing, including the current inline zero-descendant surface.
The task-switcher/task-row adapter may explicitly own the coarse-pointer inline
confirmation, and command-panel callers that request `inline` retain their
existing row-owned surface. These callers keep their established focus,
containment, and action contracts; only the mobile Kanban card changes its
surface selection.

### Classification-gated surface selection

`TaskArchiveConfirmation` keeps descendant classification as the authoritative
input for choosing between the compact confirmation and the cascade dialog. A
standard fine-pointer caller does not mount a provisional popover while the
classification is idle or loading. A resolved zero count mounts the anchored
popover; a positive count mounts the full cascade dialog; and an error mounts
the same full dialog as the fail-safe path. No archive action is exposed before
that choice is known.

The controlled archive request remains open while classification is pending, so
the final surface can mount without another user action. This avoids moving
focus and assistive-technology context from a temporary popover into a dialog.
It also preserves the existing final surfaces and their callbacks instead of
adding cascade controls to the compact popover.

A non-rendering pending-dismissal controller retains the lifecycle previously
owned by the provisional popover. Escape closes the controlled request and
returns focus to the configured trigger; a new pointer interaction closes it
without preventing the new target's interaction. If live data removes the
originating anchor, the controller closes the request before classification can
select a final surface. Closing disables the classification hook, whose cleanup
ignores any late response, so a dismissed request cannot surface later. The
controller mounts no role, action, or visual confirmation shell.

Callers whose final presentation is already known keep their current behavior.
Forced mobile Kanban and bulk operations may mount the full dialog immediately
with its action disabled until classification settles. Explicit inline and
coarse-pointer row confirmations retain their established loading treatment.

### Popover width contract

`ActionConfirmPopover` gains a small width/size contract whose default remains
the current `w-64` surface. The archive confirmation opts into a modest wider
variant, targeting `w-72`, with a viewport-aware maximum width such as
`max-w-[calc(100vw-1rem)]`. The class contract stays local to the shared
popover primitive, so watcher and other confirmation consumers do not widen
implicitly. The archive body keeps `text-pretty` wrapping and the existing
title/action hierarchy.

### Fine-pointer mounting

At the `TaskItemWithContextMenu` adapter boundary, `useResponsiveBreakpoint`
determines where the already-created archive confirmation node mounts:

- Fine-pointer confirmation mounts as a sibling of the cloned task row inside
  the existing anchor wrapper. It does not pass `archiveConfirmation` into
  `TaskItem`, so `TaskItem` does not add its `flex-wrap` row branch or the
  `basis-full` action slot for a portaled popover.
- Coarse-pointer confirmation continues to pass through `TaskItem`'s existing
  inline action slot. Its intentional row expansion and mobile action geometry
  remain unchanged.

Both branches reuse the same `useTaskSwitcherArchiveConfirmation` node,
callbacks, anchor ref, and focus-return ref. No business logic or duplicate
confirmation markup is introduced. The change removes the layout cause of
fine-pointer row growth instead of compensating for it with row dimensions.

## Data and contracts

The component preserves `data-testid="still-working-warning"`, `role="alert"`,
the translated `task:stillWorkingWarning` and subject keys, and the existing
yellow border/background/text classes. The compact style contract is:

- warning container: `gap-1.5`, `p-2.5`, `text-xs`, `leading-5`, and
  `text-pretty`;
- warning icon: `h-3.5 w-3.5`, `mt-0.5`, and `shrink-0`;
- existing rounded border, yellow semantic colors, and dark-mode contrast stay
  unchanged.

The dialog passes `discardWorktreeChanges` with the existing cascade choice.
The task API sends it as `discard_worktree_changes=true`. A typed HTTP 409 uses
`task_delete_dirty_worktree` when consent is absent. A shared client classifier
maps this code to localized feedback for single and bulk deletion surfaces.

Localization catalogs change in the five real locales. The Traditional Chinese
catalogs use the existing generation command. No browser state is persisted.

`forceDialog` is an optional internal presentation prop with a default of
`false`. It is passed from the card-owned source to the existing routing
component and does not change archive commands, descendant classification,
preference state, mutation state, or callbacks.

## Control flow

The existing task-level `foregroundActivity` projection and explicit
`isInFlight` props continue to determine whether the warning is rendered. The
dialog computes the localized task outcome and cleanup model during render,
then passes the model to the shared task-local renderer. Archive/delete
callbacks and dialog state remain untouched. The source adapter supplies the
existing `presentation` value and, for mobile Kanban only, maps it to
`forceDialog`. For a standard fine-pointer request, descendant classification
settles before the selected popover or dialog mounts. Pointer classification
continues to select the fine-pointer popover or the explicitly inline row
surface after that gate. This changes presentation timing only, not archive
commands, descendant classification, preference state, or callbacks.

The delete dialog resets discard selection when it closes. On confirm, it sends
the cascade and discard choices through the existing callback. A typed dirty
conflict keeps the task in every local cache and shows one localized message.
Other deletion errors keep their existing error handling.

## Failure and recovery

A failed descendant classification selects the full dialog without first
mounting a compact confirmation. If localized text is longer than the available
width, the shared surface-text contract wraps it inside the body. If content is
taller than the dynamic viewport, the body scrolls without moving the title or
actions.

If deletion returns `task_delete_dirty_worktree`, the task remains visible. The
localized message tells the user to reopen the confirmation and select discard.
Unknown executor types retain the generic running session effect. If no task
activity is present, no warning mounts, as before.

## Persistence

The browser does not persist discard selection or consent. Backend
cleanup-snapshot persistence, the `discard_worktree_changes` contract, and
typed HTTP 409 handling are defined in
[Dirty worktree task deletion](../../tasks/system-design/dirty-worktree-deletion.md).

## Observability

Existing component tests continue to cover warning visibility and cleanup
content. Cleanup-summary tests cover every executor, bulk grouping, ordering,
effects, and supporting notes. Delete-dialog tests cover selection reset,
disabled actions, single and bulk callback values, cascade behavior, and typed
conflict feedback. Dialog and compact-surface tests assert equivalent structured
content, semantic action variants, unchanged callbacks, and that a deferred
positive descendant result does not expose a provisional fine-pointer popover.
Pending-dismissal component cases cover Escape, trigger focus restoration, and
outside pointer intent.
Rendered desktop and phone checks cover viewport bounds, scroll ownership,
action reach, and document overflow. The desktop cascade E2E holds the
descendant-count response, dismisses the invisible request, proves a late
result cannot mount a confirmation, then reopens Archive and observes only the
cascade dialog.

## Mobile and desktop containment

The desktop check uses the real sidebar task row with a fine pointer. It
records the row `getBoundingClientRect().height` before opening Archive, while
the archive popover is visible, and after Cancel; all three values must remain
stable within subpixel precision. It also verifies the archive popover is
strictly wider than 256px and remains inside the viewport at compact widths.
For a parent task, a delayed descendant-count response leaves the confirmation
shell absent until classification settles; after release, only the full cascade
dialog is rendered and the anchored popover never becomes visible.

The phone Kanban check enters through a card overflow menu and expects the
mobile presentation to use the full alert dialog even for a zero-descendant
task. It records the card height before and during the dialog, verifies the
centered/inset surface, stacked actions, cleanup copy, dark theme tokens, and
zero document horizontal overflow, then cancels and repeats the existing
archive callback flow. The card remains unchanged while the dialog is open.

The phone task-switcher check keeps the existing coarse-pointer sidebar inline
flow. It expects that confirmation to remain intentionally row-owned, keeps
actions at or above 44px, and asserts zero document horizontal overflow.

The task-delete phone check enters through the real task drawer action menu and
opens Delete with a long task title and a longer bundled locale. After portal
animations settle, it verifies the surface's 16px viewport insets, zero
document horizontal overflow, title/body wrapping, body scroll ownership when
needed, and visible persistent actions. The discard label has a 44px touch
target and remains inside the scrolling body. Both footer actions remain
full-width and at least 44px high. A desktop check retains compact row actions.
