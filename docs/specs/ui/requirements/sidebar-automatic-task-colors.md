# Sidebar Task Colors Requirements

## Overview

The sidebar can use a personal manual task color or derive a personal color from ordered rules. Neither source changes shared task records.

The UI system owns this presentation contract. The task, workflow, executor, and repository systems continue to own the source data.

## Terminology

- **Automatic color rule:** A personal condition that supplies a task color.
- **Effective color:** The first matching automatic color. If no rule matches, it is the manual color.
- **Fixed rule color:** A color token stored as part of an automatic color rule.
- **Manual color:** A portable personal color that a user assigns directly to one task.
- **Repository target:** A stable reference to a workspace, local, built-in remote, or plugin repository.

## Requirements

### REQ-UI-SIDEBAR-AUTOMATIC-TASK-COLORS-001: Compact sidebar view editor

**Intent:** Reduce the editor height without hiding the current sort, group, task-row, or automatic-color state.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-SIDEBAR-AUTOMATIC-TASK-COLORS-001.3:** Expanding or collapsing a summary shall not create or change a saved-view draft.
- **AC-UI-SIDEBAR-AUTOMATIC-TASK-COLORS-001.4:** The editor shall show Automatic colors after Task row. It shall identify the setting as personal and global across sidebar views and workspaces through accessible help content.
- **AC-UI-SIDEBAR-AUTOMATIC-TASK-COLORS-001.5:** The Automatic colors summary shall show whether automation is off or how many rules are enabled.
- **AC-UI-SIDEBAR-AUTOMATIC-TASK-COLORS-001.6:** The collapsed Sort, Group by, and Task row summaries shall use the same compact bottom inset before their separator, and adjacent editor sections shall not add an extra primitive-level gap.
- **AC-UI-SIDEBAR-AUTOMATIC-TASK-COLORS-001.7:** When editor content exceeds the available viewport, the surface shall use one vertical scroll owner and keep every setting and action reachable.

### REQ-UI-SIDEBAR-AUTOMATIC-TASK-COLORS-002: Ordered personal color rules
