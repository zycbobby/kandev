# Task Confirmation Surface Requirements

## Overview

Task archive and delete confirmations reuse one in-flight caution. Its visual
treatment must read as supporting warning copy, not compete with the
confirmation title or primary cleanup description. The fine-pointer archive
popover must also give its copy enough room without changing unrelated
confirmation surfaces or changing the originating sidebar row's geometry.

Task archive and delete confirmations also explain what happens to the task's
runtime environment. That copy must separate the requested task action from
its cleanup effects and from resources that remain safe, instead of presenting
every sentence as an equal paragraph.

## Terminology

- **Still-working warning:** The localized caution shown when the task or one
  of the selected tasks has generating or background activity.

## Requirements

### REQ-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-WARNING-001: Compact still-working warning

**Intent:** Make in-flight caution easy to scan while preserving its semantic
meaning and the existing archive and delete workflows.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-WARNING-001.1:** When an archive or delete
  confirmation renders for an in-flight task, the still-working warning shall
  use compact secondary typography with readable line height and deliberate
  short-text wrapping, and its icon, spacing, and padding shall remain optically
  balanced with that typography.
- **AC-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-WARNING-001.2:** When the warning renders in a full
  dialog, desktop archive popover, archive inline confirmation, or shared delete
  dialog, it shall preserve its localized text, `role=alert`, restrained yellow
  semantic treatment, and existing in-flight visibility conditions.
- **AC-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-WARNING-001.3:** At desktop and phone confirmation
  widths, the warning shall remain contained without document-level horizontal
  overflow, and existing confirmation actions shall remain reachable. Full
  task cleanup dialogs shall follow the dedicated action contract in
  `AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.5`; other action geometry shall remain
  unchanged.

### REQ-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-SURFACE-002: Stable fine-pointer archive surface

**Intent:** Give the fine-pointer archive confirmation readable width while
keeping the source sidebar row stable and preserving the intentional coarse
pointer inline confirmation behavior.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-SURFACE-002.1:** The fine-pointer archive popover
  shall use an archive-only width opt-in wider than the existing 256px default
  (targeting a modest `w-72` contract after rendered inspection), with a
  viewport-aware maximum width. Unrelated `ActionConfirmPopover` consumers
  shall retain the existing `w-64` default.
- **AC-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-SURFACE-002.2:** Opening and cancelling the
  fine-pointer archive popover shall leave the originating sidebar task row's
  `getBoundingClientRect().height` stable within normal subpixel precision.
  The implementation shall remove the source of any extra flex line rather
  than mask it with fixed or minimum row height, negative margins, or a
  tolerance-only assertion.
- **AC-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-SURFACE-002.3:** The fine-pointer popover shall
  preserve its existing anchor, focus-return boundary, confirmation callbacks,
  and compact desktop/tablet viewport containment. Coarse-pointer inline
  confirmation may continue to expand its row and shall retain its existing
  44px action geometry and zero-overflow behavior.
- **AC-TASKS-CONFIRMATION-SURFACE-002.4:** When a fine-pointer archive action
  needs descendant classification before choosing its confirmation surface, no
  provisional confirmation popover or archive action shall appear while that
  classification is pending. After classification, exactly one final surface
  shall appear: the anchored popover for zero descendants, or the full dialog
  for one or more descendants. An unavailable classification shall fail safe to
  the full dialog without first showing the popover. While no surface is
  visible, Escape or a new pointer interaction shall dismiss the pending
  request; keyboard dismissal shall restore trigger focus, and a late
  classification result shall not mount a confirmation after dismissal.

### REQ-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001: Scannable task cleanup confirmation

**Intent:** Make task archive and delete consequences easy to distinguish and
operate without changing task cleanup behavior.

**User story:** As a user archiving or deleting a task, I want the confirmation
to distinguish the task action, affected runtime resources, and protected
repository resources, so that I can understand the consequence before acting.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.1:** A single-task confirmation shall
  identify the named task and state the requested archive or delete outcome
  directly. Delete shall state that the action cannot be undone without adding
  a redundant generic confirmation question.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.2:** Cleanup effects shall appear as one
  scannable semantic group. Information about repository files, branches, or
  folders that remain untouched shall read as supporting reassurance rather
  than as another destructive effect.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.3:** Single and bulk confirmations shall
  preserve the current executor-specific distinctions for local, worktree,
  local Docker, remote Docker, Sprites, SSH, unknown executors, and running
  agent sessions in every supported locale.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.4:** Full dialogs, the archive popover,
  and the archive inline confirmation shall derive their cleanup content from
  the same structured model. Each surface may use its established density, but
  shall preserve the same effects, reassurance, and order.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.5:** At phone widths, full task cleanup
  dialogs shall remain centered and inset within the visual viewport, create no
  document horizontal overflow, keep overflowing content reachable, and expose
  stacked full-width actions at least 44 CSS px high. Tablet and desktop shall
  retain compact row actions.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.6:** Delete shall use the design
  system's semantic destructive action treatment without a competing primary
  treatment. Archive shall retain its non-destructive action treatment.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.7:** Cancel, dismiss, focus, Escape,
  Enter default-action behavior, archive/delete mutation loading state, cascade
  selection, in-flight warning visibility, and single/bulk archive and delete
  callbacks shall remain unchanged.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.8:** When archive is initiated from a
  phone Kanban card, the card shall use the contained full task-cleanup alert
  dialog even when the task has no descendants. The dialog shall be centered
  and inset, use the existing theme tokens, keep its content internally
  scrollable, and expose stacked full-width actions at least 44 CSS px high;
  no inline confirmation shall be inserted between cards or change the card's
  height, board URL, or selected task. Fine-pointer desktop and compact-desktop
  Kanban shall retain their anchored archive popover. Coarse-pointer tablet
  Kanban shall retain its existing routing, including its current inline
  zero-descendant surface. Task-switcher/task-row surfaces shall retain their
  intentional row-owned coarse-pointer inline confirmation, and a disabled
  archive-confirmation preference shall continue to bypass the surface.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.11:** When the task's executor
  projection is absent but task-owned worktree state may remain after the last
  session ends, the delete confirmation shall fail closed by showing the same
  explicit discard selection.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.12:** When delete can remove one or more
  task worktrees, the confirmation shall state that tracked and untracked local
  changes will be permanently discarded. The destructive action shall require
  an explicit selection for this outcome.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.13:** When the backend rejects deletion
  because discard consent is absent, every task deletion surface shall keep the
  task visible and show a localized explanation. The explanation shall tell the
  user how to retry with explicit consent.
- **AC-UI-TASK-CLEANUP-CONFIRMATION-001.14:** At phone widths, the discard
  selection shall remain inside the existing centered dialog and its scrolling
  body. Its label shall provide a touch target of at least 44 CSS px.

## Out of scope

- Rewriting or re-translating the still-working warning.
- Widening all confirmation popovers globally.
- Changing in-flight detection, archive behavior, focus handling, Escape
  handling, or safe-area handling.
- Changing compact archive popover/inline or unrelated dialog action
  dimensions.
- Replacing the centered task alerts with a drawer, sheet, or new navigation
  flow.
- Changing the descendant-count API or introducing background prefetching for
  archive confirmation.
- Masking sidebar row layout changes with fixed/minimum heights or negative
  offsets.
- Adding animation or redesigning any confirmation surface beyond the shared
  warning density and the task cleanup hierarchy above.
