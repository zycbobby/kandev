# Bounded Task Status Delivery System Design

## Purpose and boundaries

This design preserves the technical source detail for `REQ-PLATFORM-BOUNDED-TASK-STATUS-DELIVERY-001` during migration.

## Requirement mapping

| Requirement | Design section |
| --- | --- |
| `REQ-PLATFORM-BOUNDED-TASK-STATUS-DELIVERY-001` | [Migrated source detail](#migrated-source-detail) |

## Migrated source detail

## Why

Task rows currently obtain compact status indicators by observing large,
session-owned streams. With many agents working, one browser receives messages,
shell activity, model updates, MCP state, and Git events from sessions that are
not open. Switching tasks rebuilds those subscriptions. The resulting traffic
can delay or drop request responses, producing an unknown message-send result
and temporarily hiding active-session controls such as the model selector.

Task-level navigation needs a bounded status contract. Session detail still
needs rich streams, but opening a workspace must not make every session a
detail surface.

## What

- Every task snapshot may carry a `status_summary` containing the complete set
  of runtime facts needed by desktop and mobile task switchers.
- The backend derives that summary from authoritative task, session, message,
  Git, and pull-request state. It is a rebuildable read model, not a second
  source of truth.
- Summary updates use the existing workspace task feed. Task rows never
  subscribe to a session merely to obtain a badge.
- Full session snapshots and live session notifications are delivered only to
  explicitly opened session detail surfaces.
- Repeated subscribe/focus requests do not replay full session state. Git
  refresh has a targeted action that does not alter focus.
- Correlated WebSocket responses and errors are prioritized over unsolicited
  notifications and cannot be silently dropped by notification pressure.
- One session's streaming text or reasoning cannot monopolize persistence,
  notification delivery, or browser state work. Intermediate replacement
  updates are bounded while the final transcript remains lossless.
- `message.add` uses a stable client-generated message ID so an uncertain send
  can be reconciled or retried without creating or dispatching a duplicate.
- Existing desktop and mobile status/icon precedence remains unchanged.
- Startup recovery publishes every repaired session state through the semantic task event path.
  Persisted summaries converge before the backend reports readiness.

## Task status summary

The wire field is `status_summary`; the frontend maps it to `statusSummary`.
The initial contract is:

| Field                                          | Meaning                                                             | Bound                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `revision`, `updated_at`                       | Monotonic task-local version and projection time                    | Constant                             |
| `last_activity_at`                             | Latest durable task, user-prompt, or turn milestone                 | Constant                             |
| `primary_session`                              | Primary session ID and lifecycle state                              | One session                          |
| `foreground_activity`, `active_subagent_count` | Existing task-level busy aggregate                                  | Constant                             |
| `pending_action`                               | `permission`, `clarification`, or absent                            | Constant                             |
| `active_error`                                 | Optional session and task-repository IDs, stamp, time, preview, category, and actions | One preview and at most three known actions |
| `git`                                          | Aggregate additions, deletions, changed files, ahead, and behind    | Numeric totals only                  |
| `pull_request`                                 | Count, bounded representative identity, and aggregate display state | Constant regardless of PR count      |

`pull_request.aggregate_state` is one of `failure`, `blocked`, `pending`,
`awaiting_review`, `ready`, `passing`, `draft`, `merged`, `closed`, or
`neutral`. It preserves the existing most-attention-worthy task-row rule.

The summary never contains message bodies, transcript entries, file names,
patches, shell output, model lists, MCP payloads, or an unbounded array of
sessions, repositories, or pull requests. Existing flat task runtime fields may
remain during migration, but switchers use the summary when present.

## Derivation rules

- Pending permission outranks pending clarification for the row's primary
  state icon. Both outrank generating/background activity, which outranks
  coarse lifecycle state. This is the existing task-row precedence.
- A clarification contributes to `pending_action` only while its bundle is pending in the session's
  current authoritative `task_session_turns` record. An empty, unattempted
  `prompt_dispatch_pending` reservation does not advance this boundary. A message-backed reservation or
  one marked `prompt_dispatch_attempted` is authoritative because dispatch may have occurred. Within
  that turn, unrelated rows do not clear the request. A newer authoritative turn supersedes older
  pending clarification rows without requiring transcript history to be rewritten; deleting newer-turn
  messages cannot move this boundary backward.
- Within the same current turn, a session's `pending_action` clears only when the specific request that
  armed it resolves: a `message.updated` on that same permission/clarification
  request row (matched by type and `pending_id`) reaching a terminal,
  non-`pending` status, or that row's deletion. An unrelated message on the
  same session (a tool call, script execution, or any other row that merely
  carries its own terminal status metadata) must not clear a different
  session's armed `pending_action`, and must not clear the current session's
  same-turn `pending_action` unless it is that same request row. Otherwise a session that
  is busy streaming ordinary tool activity right after a permission/
  clarification request clears the affordance before the user ever answers it.
- Pending-sensitive source events refresh from the bounded repository projection instead of trusting
  event order as state. Boot and task-list hydration reconcile the pending field of existing persisted
  summaries as well as creating missing summaries. Repairs preserve unrelated fields and advance the
  monotonic revision only when pending semantics change.
- When no persisted summary row exists, the first source event rehydrates configured authoritative
  session, Git, and pull-request observations before deriving the new row. The event therefore updates
  one keyed observation without discarding unchanged siblings from other keys.
- `active_error` is independent of the primary state icon. It represents the
  newest relevant session error or task-owned pre-session launch error.
- `active_error.session_id` is optional for a task-owned error.
  `task_repository_id` identifies one exact recovery target when it exists.
- `active_error.preview` has at most 512 UTF-8 bytes.
  `category` has at most 64 UTF-8 bytes.
- `active_error.recovery_actions` contains only known action values.
  The projector removes duplicates, preserves order, and keeps at most three values.
- A session error clears after an authoritative dismissal or a newer agent response.
  A task-owned launch error clears after a successful launch, recovery, or terminal move.
- Successful session deletion is an authoritative removal of that session's
  error. The summary removes the error without a backend restart or another
  session event.
- Git totals aggregate the latest observation for every repository in the
  task. A multi-repository update must not expose a partial replacement that
  forgets unchanged repositories. On projector restart, configured keyed Git
  observations are rehydrated even when the persisted aggregate is absent.
- Pull-request state aggregates open PRs before terminal PRs and chooses the
  most attention-worthy current status. Full PR details remain owned by the
  GitHub domain and are loaded only by surfaces that need them. On projector
  restart or compare-and-set rebase, configured keyed pull-request observations
  are rehydrated even when the persisted aggregate is absent.
- A semantic no-op does not increment `revision` or emit an update.
- Clients ignore a summary delta whose revision is not newer than the stored
  revision.
- `last_activity_at` is separate from projection freshness. Task creation,
  persisted task mutations, user-authored prompts, and turn start or completion
  advance it by source time. Focus, subscriptions, Git or pull-request polling,
  queue bookkeeping, summary repair, and streamed chunks do not advance it.
- Missing and older summaries rebuild `last_activity_at` in one batch from
  task, user-message, and turn records. Live and rebuilt values use a monotonic
  maximum, so replay and repair cannot move activity backward. See
  [ADR-2026-08-17-separate-task-activity-from-summary-freshness](../../../decisions/2026-08-17-separate-task-activity-from-summary-freshness.md).

## API and event surface

- Boot state, task-list responses, and workflow snapshots include the latest
  `status_summary` without per-task queries.
- `task.status_summary.updated` is workspace-scoped and carries `task_id`,
  `workspace_id`, and the complete replacement summary. It uses the same
  authorization and subscription boundary as other task updates.
- `session.subscribe` sends the full initial session snapshot only when that
  client newly joins the session. A duplicate subscribe only acknowledges the
  request.
- `session.focus` changes focus/poll priority and acknowledges the request; it
  does not replay a session snapshot.
- `session.git.refresh` requests a fresh Git observation for the selected
  session without changing focus or subscription membership.
- WebSocket request responses/errors use a reserved control path. If the
  server cannot enqueue control traffic, it closes the connection so the
  client enters explicit reconnect/reconciliation instead of waiting on a
  response that was silently discarded.
- Web clients send a stable `client_message_id` with `message.add` (the
  backend also accepts `message_id` as a compatibility alias). The first
  accepted request owns that ID. A retry in the same authorized task returns
  the persisted message and skips session-state transitions, turn-start hooks,
  message creation, and prompt dispatch. Reuse outside that scope is rejected.

## Persistence guarantees

- The latest task status summary is stored by task ID with workspace ID,
  revision, JSON payload, and update time using migrations supported by both
  SQLite and Postgres.
- Summary persistence and revision changes are serialized per task. A
  compare-and-update or equivalent transaction prevents concurrent source
  events from publishing duplicate revisions or losing a newer value.
- Missing rows are rebuilt from authoritative records. List and boot loaders
  batch summary reads and may batch repairs; they do not perform an N+1 query.
- Existing rows are repaired after startup recovery changes authoritative session state. Missing-row
  hydration is not the only recovery path for a stale summary.
- Session deletion repair serializes the authoritative row removal, retained-error
  selection, and inactive/active error publication by task. Concurrent deletions
  therefore cannot restore an error for a session that has already been removed.
- Live Git observations remain coalesced before persistence/publication.
  Running executions maintain the slow monitoring baseline independently of
  browser subscribers; active focus may request fast monitoring. Settled tasks
  retain the latest stable snapshot.
- Message IDs remain stable through reconnect, retry, response hydration, and
  notification hydration. Duplicate notifications and responses upsert the
  same frontend message.

## Session stream overload isolation

Agent stream chunks are an ingress format, not a required persistence or
browser-render cadence. The lifecycle boundary coalesces adjacent assistant or
reasoning chunks for the same Kandev message record before publishing them to
the orchestrator:

- the first non-empty chunk creates the streaming record without waiting for a
  coalescing interval;
- subsequent adjacent chunks for that record publish at most once per 100 ms
  window while streaming continues;
- concatenation preserves byte order and content exactly; coalescing may not
  truncate, summarize, or rewrite agent output; and
- pending content flushes before a tool call/result, permission request,
  completion, error, stream disconnect, execution replacement, or backend
  shutdown so persisted transcript order remains authoritative.

The per-agent ACP adapter and process handoff apply cancellation-aware
backpressure when their bounded handoff queues fill. They must not silently
drop normalized assistant/reasoning chunks before the lifecycle coalescer; a
noisy session may slow its own agent process, and shutdown cancellation may
discard only work after that session is terminal. This handoff is scoped to the
agent instance and must not block unrelated backend sessions.

The WebSocket gateway treats `session.message.updated` as a replaceable full-
state notification keyed by client, session, and message. At most one unsent
replacement for a key occupies delivery capacity. A newer update replaces the
older payload in place. Replaceable stream notifications use bounded
per-session capacity and fair scheduling, separate from correlated control
traffic and semantic notifications such as message creation/deletion, task or
session state changes, pending-input occurrences, and turn completion. When a
session exceeds its replaceable allowance, that session's oldest queued
replaceable entry may be evicted; it cannot consume another session's
allowance or the semantic-notification lane. Reconnect, snapshot, and
turn-settle reconciliation repair any intermediate replacement that was not
delivered because the database remains authoritative.

The frontend applies the same defense at the render boundary. It keeps only the
newest `session.message.updated` payload for each message during one animation
frame and performs one store update per changed message when the frame flushes.
Message add/delete and turn-settle events remain ordered barriers. Intentional
multi-session detail surfaces may subscribe to every session they display, but
rerendering or refetching equivalent session objects must not tear down and
recreate unchanged subscription membership.

Overload handling is observable. Structured metrics/logs identify the client,
session, action, queue class, coalesced chunk count, replacement count, and
eviction count without logging transcript content. Reconnect, a selected-
session snapshot, or turn-settle reconciliation repairs any skipped
intermediate replacement.

## Failure modes

- If projection fails, the last valid summary remains visible, the failure is
  logged with task/source context, and the next semantic source event or
  authoritative rebuild can repair it.
- If a summary delta is dropped, reconnect or a task-list/workflow refresh
  supplies the complete current summary. The browser does not fall back to
  background session subscriptions.
- If Git monitoring fails, the summary retains the last observation and does
  not claim a clean tree from missing data.
- If a message response is interrupted, the client reconciles the same
  `client_message_id`/persisted message ID from the response, notification, or
  message list, then retries that ID when needed. It reports an unknown outcome only after bounded
  reconciliation cannot determine acceptance.
- Notification overload may coalesce or drop replaceable notifications, but
  it cannot silently discard a correlated response/error.
- If one session exceeds its replaceable stream allowance, other sessions and
  semantic notifications continue to make progress. The noisy session retains
  exact persisted content and converges through its newest replacement or
  normal reconciliation.
- If `status_summary` is temporarily absent during rollout, task rows use the
  existing coarse task fields and omit unavailable decorations; they do not
  subscribe to inactive sessions.
- If recoverable-error handling cannot read a session because of a transient
  database or metadata error, it logs the read failure and keeps the existing
  recovery, state-reconciliation, and cleanup behavior. Only an authoritative
  missing-session result suppresses those side effects.
- If task-owned launch-error metadata is malformed, the projector ignores that
  record. It does not reject or erase the last valid summary.

## Scenarios

- **GIVEN** a workspace with 27 tasks and one selected session, **WHEN** the
  task switcher loads, **THEN** no inactive session is subscribed and no
  inactive message, shell, model, MCP, or Git stream is delivered for a row.
- **GIVEN** the same workspace, **WHEN** the user switches tasks repeatedly,
  **THEN** subscription work is proportional to the sessions opened/closed by
  each switch and does not grow with the number of workspace tasks.
- **GIVEN** a background task asks a question, encounters a recoverable error,
  changes its Git tree, or receives a PR update, **WHEN** its summary revision
  arrives, **THEN** desktop and mobile rows update without a session
  subscription.
- **GIVEN** an idle task receives Git or pull-request summary changes, **WHEN**
  its replacement summary arrives, **THEN** `updated_at` can advance while
  `last_activity_at` remains unchanged.
- **GIVEN** a recoverable error is dismissed or followed by a newer agent
  response, **WHEN** the projector processes that occurrence, **THEN** the
  independent error indicator clears on both task switchers.
- **GIVEN** auto-start stops before it creates a session, **WHEN** the task stores
  a `last_launch_error`, **THEN** `active_error` carries it without a session ID.
- **GIVEN** a task-owned error and a session-owned error, **WHEN** the summary
  rebuilds, **THEN** `active_error` contains the newer active record.
- **GIVEN** a stopped session owns the task's `active_error`, **WHEN** the user
  deletes that session, **THEN** desktop and mobile task switchers remove its
  error indicator while the task and replacement sessions remain available.
- **GIVEN** two sessions have recoverable errors and the stored summary points
  to the newer error, **WHEN** the projector restarts and the newer session is
  deleted, **THEN** the retained session's error becomes the task's
  `active_error` instead of leaving the summary empty.
- **GIVEN** keyed Git observations committed before their aggregate summary,
  **WHEN** the projector restarts with a nil persisted Git aggregate and later
  receives one repository event, **THEN** it rehydrates every repository before
  rebuilding totals so unchanged siblings remain included.
- **GIVEN** authoritative session, Git, or pull-request observations exist but no
  task summary row has been persisted, **WHEN** the projector receives its first
  source event, **THEN** it rehydrates every configured source before creating
  the row so unchanged siblings remain included.
- **GIVEN** two sessions in one task have recoverable errors, **WHEN** both
  sessions are deleted concurrently while retained-error repair is in flight,
  **THEN** the final task summary contains no error for either deleted session.
- **GIVEN** a session's agent requests permission and, before that request is
  answered, the same session emits an unrelated tool call/execute/read message
  that reaches its own terminal status, **WHEN** the projector processes that
  unrelated message, **THEN** `pending_action` for the session remains
  `permission` (the affordance does not flash and disappear before the user
  answers it).
- **GIVEN** a detached clarification row is pending in an older turn and the current turn has no
  pending input, **WHEN** a summary is projected or hydrated, **THEN** the session and task omit
  `pending_action` and later turn completion cannot re-arm it.
- **GIVEN** an existing persisted summary advertises clarification but the bounded current-turn query
  returns no pending action, **WHEN** a task-list or boot payload is built, **THEN** the persisted and
  returned summary advance to a newer revision with the clarification removed.
- **GIVEN** notification traffic saturates its queue, **WHEN** the selected
  session sends `message.add`, **THEN** the correlated response is delivered
  first or the connection closes for deterministic reconciliation.
- **GIVEN** the first message response becomes uncertain, **WHEN** the client
  retries the same `client_message_id`, **THEN** exactly one user message is stored and
  the duplicate request does not dispatch a second prompt.
- **GIVEN** many background sessions are active, **WHEN** the selected agent
  publishes model configuration, **THEN** the selected chat retains its model
  selector and can submit a follow-up message.
- **GIVEN** one ACP session emits 30,000 tiny reasoning chunks for one message,
  **WHEN** the stream crosses the lifecycle, persistence, gateway, and browser
  boundaries, **THEN** the final reasoning content is byte-for-byte complete,
  append publications occur no more than once per 100 ms window, and pending
  replacement work remains bounded.
- **GIVEN** a noisy session is continuously streaming, **WHEN** the user opens
  another task or submits a message in another selected session, **THEN** that
  navigation and its correlated response complete without waiting for the
  noisy session's backlog.
- **GIVEN** an Office task detail refetch returns new objects for the same set
  of session IDs, **WHEN** React rerenders the page, **THEN** the client sends no
  unsubscribe, subscribe, or initial-snapshot replay for unchanged membership.
- **GIVEN** a phone viewport, **WHEN** task summaries change, **THEN** the
  existing task-switcher sheet shows the same badges and precedence as the
  desktop sidebar without new navigation, scroll, or touch behavior.
- **GIVEN** a stored summary reports a `RUNNING` primary session with `generating` activity,
  **WHEN** startup recovery changes that session to `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`, **THEN** a newer summary
  reports the waiting state and no generating activity before the backend reports readiness.

## Out of scope

- Moving full transcripts, diffs, shell output, model configuration, or MCP
  state into tasks.
- Replacing authoritative session, message, Git, or GitHub persistence.
- Redesigning desktop or mobile task-switcher layout and interactions.
- Preventing detail surfaces such as Office or explicit multi-session views
  from subscribing to sessions they intentionally display.
- Guaranteeing external agent prompt execution exactly once across a complete
  backend process crash; this contract prevents duplicate handler dispatch on
  client retry.
- Treating a larger timeout or queue capacity as the fix.
- Limiting how much reasoning or assistant content an agent may ultimately
  produce. This contract bounds intermediate work, not transcript length.
- Automatically stopping or penalizing an agent solely because it emits many
  valid chunks.
