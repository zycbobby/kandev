# Workspace system

## Purpose

The workspace system owns workspace lifecycle, repositories, worktrees,
branches, branch policies, workspace secrets, and workspace-scoped execution context.

## Ownership

This system owns workspace creation and deletion, repository attachment,
repository sets, local repositories, branch templates, secrets, and workspace
Git state.

## Exclusions

- Task-owned worktree lifetime belongs to the [task system](../tasks/README.md).
- Provider credentials belong to the [integration system](../integrations/README.md).
- Workspace settings presentation belongs to the [UI system](../ui/README.md).
