# Secret reference protection

## Scope and requirement mapping

This design covers AC-WORKSPACES-REPOSITORY-SECRETS-001.9 through .12.
The existing repository-secrets requirement retains the other runtime and storage contracts during specification migration.

## Deletion boundary

`secrets.Service` authorizes the secret, checks references, and delegates deletion to the existing store.
An injected reference checker keeps the secrets package independent of profile and task repositories.
`backendapp` wires the checker from the existing agent-settings and task repositories.
It reads active agent profiles, all executor profiles, and active repositories across workspaces.
Workspace-scoped profile and repository metadata is disclosed only after workspace access succeeds.
Inaccessible references still block deletion, with their metadata omitted.

HTTP deletion returns `409` with `error`, `code: secret_in_use`, and `references`.
Each reference contains `kind`, `id`, `name`, and `key`. Hidden references contain only `kind`.
`GET /api/v1/secrets/:id/references` returns the same authorized reference projection without changing the secret. Workspace secrets require the existing `workspace_id` query parameter.
WebSocket deletion returns `CONFLICT` with equivalent details.
HTTP `?force=true` and the WebSocket boolean `force` bypass the reference check after authorization.
Missing or unauthorized secrets retain `404` behavior. Unexpected errors return sanitized `500` or `INTERNAL_ERROR` responses.

The store remains available to internal credential cleanup and workspace cascades.
No schema or foreign-key migration is required. Existing broken references remain available for manual repair.
`UserVisibleStore.DeleteForWorkspace` preserves the authorized workspace scope through the final deletion boundary.
Its default `Delete` continues to accept Global secrets only.
The check protects references present during lookup. It does not serialize concurrent profile saves with deletion across repository owners.

## Resolution and recovery

`environment.SecretError` retains redacted errors and adds a repair instruction for the source environment.
Lifecycle error wrapping includes the selected agent profile name for agent-profile failures.
Origin classification and precedence remain unchanged. Secret IDs and underlying reveal errors stay out of rendered errors.

Automatic name matching is excluded because a replacement name does not establish the original credential identity or authority.
Existing scope-transfer operations remain unchanged in this repair.

## Settings feedback and mobile parity

Opening a secret-delete confirmation starts the read-only reference request. While it is pending, the row-local desktop popover or mobile inline confirmation remains visible with its destructive action disabled.
An unreferenced secret keeps that local confirmation and requires a separate Delete action.
Existing references replace it with the same contained conflict-dialog pattern used by agent-profile deletion. The dialog presents each visible reference as a resource card with an icon, localized type badge, name, and environment key, and offers only Close. Only the resource list scrolls when it is long; the explanation and footer remain visible.
The dialog uses full-width touch actions below the small-screen breakpoint, remains within the dynamic viewport, and never exposes secret values or inaccessible resource metadata.
The final Delete request repeats the service reference check. A reference created after preflight reopens the conflict dialog from the structured `409`; unknown failures retain the generic localized toast.
Desktop and mobile Playwright coverage proves both the safe delete and preflight-conflict paths.

## Evidence

HTTP and WebSocket tests exercise the real service and encrypted SQLite store.
Reference-collector tests exercise profile and repository selection, redaction, and lookup failures.
Runtime tests cover actionable errors, profile identity, redaction, and all-or-nothing resolution.
