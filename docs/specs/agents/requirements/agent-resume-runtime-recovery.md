# Agent Resume and Runtime Recovery Requirements

## Overview

Preserve the observable behavior documented for Agent Resume and Runtime Recovery.

## Requirements

### REQ-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001: Agent Resume and Runtime Recovery

**Intent:** Preserve the observable behavior documented for Agent Resume and Runtime Recovery.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.1:** A process startup, ACP initialize, or transport failure does not discard the stored resume token. Resume retries the same provider-native session.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.2:** The stored token is cleared only when the user explicitly chooses **Start fresh**, or is replaced after the agent successfully creates a new provider-native session.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.3:** An authorized resume moves the task session to `STARTING` under the existing per-session resume lock before request assembly reaches scoped GitHub credential issuance. This makes the session eligible for a lease without weakening the credential broker's terminal-session rejection.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.4:** A successful resume persists the non-secret Git credential routing snapshot while the session is still guarded `STARTING`, so the task detail view does not retain an earlier workspace/executor credential policy.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.5:** If request assembly, credential issuance, or launch fails after that early transition, Kandev restores the prior recoverable session state unless another terminal transition won the race.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.6:** A completed turn remains represented by the task's review state while its persisted response and session lifecycle state settle. After a backend restart and automatic resume, the prior transcript remains visible and the task returns to the Turn Finished review bucket once the session is again `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`; it does not settle in Backlog or Running.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.7:** The explicit managed-runtime update path may invalidate only the deterministic `_npx` execution directory for the selected built-in package after an initial update failure, then retry once and run the normal ACP capability probe.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.8:** **GIVEN** a valid OpenCode resume token, **WHEN** the OpenCode child exits before answering ACP `initialize`, **THEN** Kandev shows the normal recovery action and retains the same token for the next Resume attempt.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-001.9:** When a resumed session re-enters workspace preparation, Kandev shall publish a terminal preparation result after preparation finishes. A session that has returned to `WAITING_FOR_INPUT` without detached activity shall not remain visibly preparing or appear to have background work.

### REQ-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002: Visible resume failure feedback

**Intent:** Give the user the real failure cause and a visible next action when session recovery fails.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.1:** A failed `session.recover` request shows the backend error near the recovery controls. The error remains visible after the request ends and after repeated attempts.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.2:** A failed automatic resume that restores the workspace in read-only mode shows a nonblocking notice. The notice includes the resume failure cause and states that the restored workspace is read-only.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.3:** If resume and read-only workspace restore both fail, the recovery surface shows both causes. It does not replace them with only a generic message.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.4:** A user can select read-only workspace restore after a manual resume failure. Kandev does not silently replace a manual Resume request with read-only restore.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.5:** Desktop, narrow desktop, and mobile task views use the existing inline alert and chat recovery patterns. Recovery actions remain reachable by keyboard and touch without horizontal overflow.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.6:** A Retry recovery control is disabled while its recovery request is in flight on every recovery surface. A repeated attempt cannot create overlapping `session.recover` requests.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.7:** When task navigation changes the active task while an automatic session-status or recovery request is in flight, the task view ignores the result owned by the prior task-session identity. An error from the prior identity does not appear on the newly selected task. Each navigation cycle invalidates prior attempts even when the task-session pair later repeats.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.8:** When automatic recovery fails, the default view shall show a short localized summary and applicable recovery actions. An expandable details control shall retain each failure cause with its operation label. Technical identifiers and nested transport errors shall not appear in the collapsed summary.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-002.9:** On desktop and mobile, users shall be able to expand recovery details, read both failure causes, and retry using keyboard or touch. Details shall wrap without horizontal page overflow. Retry shall remain disabled during the request.

### REQ-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-004: Recovery across task archive transitions

**Intent:** Keep archived history readable and resume eligible work after the user unarchives its task.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-004.1:** Opening or reconnecting to an archived task shall not start an agent or restore a live workspace. History and the existing Unarchive action shall remain available without a recovery failure banner.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-004.2:** Session status for an archived task shall report that automatic resume and workspace restoration are not needed. Direct resume or restore requests shall reject the archived state without creating a runtime or changing the stored conversation identity.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-004.3:** When a task becomes archived during a recovery attempt, the task view shall discard obsolete recovery feedback and shall not begin a fallback restore. A later unarchive shall not make an earlier attempt current again.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-004.4:** After successful unarchive in an open task view, recovery eligibility shall be checked again without a page reload. An archive-cancelled session shall follow normal resume policy, including the preference that prevents automatic agent starts on open. Failed unarchive shall leave recovery disabled.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-004.5:** When the task retains recoverable workspace ownership and branch data, recovery after unarchive shall use the existing task session and workspace recovery path. It shall preserve any valid provider conversation identity. Explicitly stopped and completed sessions shall retain their existing automatic-start policy.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-004.6:** If recovery after unarchive cannot resolve the workspace, the view shall preserve history and show the failure with applicable actions. It shall not claim that missing files were restored or silently replace a lost branch or provider conversation.

Archive resource ownership remains defined by the task runtime cleanup contract.
These criteria define session recovery eligibility and its visible outcomes.

### REQ-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003: Explicit continuation after branch loss

**Intent:** Continue the same provider conversation on a new branch when the old branch cannot be recovered.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.1:** When resume returns an error that matches `worktree.ErrBranchUnrecoverable`, Kandev offers an explicit **Continue on a new branch** action. Kandev does not switch branches before the user selects this action.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.2:** The action keeps the same `TaskSession`, stored resume token, and ACP session identity. It creates a fresh worktree on a unique branch from the task repository's configured base branch.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.3:** The new branch uses the normal worktree branch template and suffix generation. It remains owned by the task environment and does not create a session-owned worktree record.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.4:** After continuation succeeds, the chat contains a persisted warning. The warning states that the original branch is gone, the conversation history continues, and code changes from the lost branch were not recovered.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.5:** The warning has `variant = "warning"` and `kind = "branch_recreated"`. Its structured metadata contains the original branch, new branch, base branch, task session ID, and repository ID.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.6:** Warning persistence is idempotent for one branch replacement. Reconnect, replay, and page reload do not create duplicate messages.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.7:** In a task with multiple repositories, Kandev replaces only worktrees whose branches are confirmed unrecoverable. Valid worktrees continue to use their current branches. Kandev persists one warning for each replaced branch.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.8:** Other resume failures do not offer branch replacement. **Start fresh** keeps its current behavior and remains the only recovery action that intentionally clears the stored conversation identity.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.9:** Attach-only worktree preflight treats a branch as unrecoverable only after a bounded noninteractive probe confirms that the configured remote does not contain it. Authentication, network, timeout, and other probe failures remain ordinary recovery failures.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.10:** If replacement checkout creation succeeds but persistence of the existing task-environment repository record fails, Kandev removes the replacement checkout and its newly created branch. The prior record remains authoritative for retry.
- **AC-AGENTS-AGENT-RESUME-RUNTIME-RECOVERY-003.11:** Once explicit replacement has materialized, Kandev attempts warning persistence on every terminal resume path, including provider startup and readiness failures. A later retry can recover a warning after a failed message write.

## Migrated source detail

## Broken behavior

An agent process or ACP handshake can fail before Kandev has attempted to load
the stored provider-native session. Kandev currently treats every such failure
as proof that the saved session is unusable and clears the operational resume
token. A later retry therefore starts a new provider-native conversation even
though the original session remains valid.

A failed or cancelled GitHub-backed session also requests a new scoped
credential lease while its persisted state is still terminal. Resume assembles
the request before persisting `STARTING`, and request assembly itself issues
the lease; moving the transition only ahead of `LaunchAgent` therefore leaves
the broker boundary too early. The credential broker correctly rejects the
terminal session, so the user-visible Resume action cannot reach agent launch.

Managed npm runtimes can retain a truncated or otherwise corrupt extracted
`_npx` execution tree even when npm's content-addressable package cache is
healthy. Re-running the current update command can reuse that tree and fail
without repairing it.

## Persistence and security constraints

- `task_sessions.metadata.acp.session_id` and
  `executors_running.resume_token` continue to identify the provider-native
  conversation until explicit fresh start or successful replacement.
- A failed pre-session launch must not blank either persisted identity.
- Resume state changes use the existing guarded session transition and
  publication path; direct unguarded state writes are not introduced.
- The GitHub credential broker continues to reject `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, and
  `CANCELLED` sessions. Recovery obtains a lease only after the authorized
  resume has persisted `STARTING`.
- Runtime cache repair accepts only package names from built-in agent metadata,
  resolves npm's cache root through direct argv, and removes only
  `<cache>/_npx/<package-key>`. It never accepts a caller-provided path or runs
  a global cache clean.
- Branch replacement updates the task environment repository record. It does
  not introduce a session-owned worktree record.
- Branch replacement does not clear or replace the stored resume token before
  the provider resumes the existing conversation.
- The branch replacement option is available only for a typed error that wraps
  `worktree.ErrBranchUnrecoverable`. Network, authentication, and transient Git
  errors remain failures.
- Attach-only branch-loss classification uses a bounded noninteractive remote
  probe when local and remote-tracking refs are absent. A missing tracking ref
  alone is not proof that the configured remote branch was deleted.
- Replacement persistence is compensating: if the existing task-environment
  repository update fails after checkout creation, the new checkout and branch
  are removed and the old database record is left unchanged.
- The persisted warning uses an atomic metadata claim before message creation.
  A failed message write releases the claim so a later retry can persist it.

## Regression scenarios

- **GIVEN** a valid OpenCode resume token, **WHEN** the OpenCode child exits
  before answering ACP `initialize`, **THEN** Kandev shows the normal recovery
  action and retains the same token for the next Resume attempt.
- **GIVEN** a resume attempt whose ACP transport disconnects before
  `session/load` completes, **WHEN** the attempt fails, **THEN** Kandev retains
  the token so a later healthy process can retry it.
- **GIVEN** a failed GitHub-backed session, **WHEN** the user selects Resume,
  **THEN** the session is persisted as `STARTING` before
  `buildResumeRequest` requests the credential lease and the launch can
  proceed.
- **GIVEN** a resume selects a credential policy different from the previous
  attempt, **WHEN** credential setup succeeds, **THEN** the non-secret
  `git_credential_snapshot` is persisted before launch and reflects the new
  policy.
- **GIVEN** that request construction, credential issuance, or launch fails
  after the early `STARTING` transition, **WHEN** recovery handling completes,
  **THEN** the session is recoverable and no stale `STARTING` state remains.
- **GIVEN** a task whose completed-turn response is persisted before its
  session lifecycle reaches its settled state, **WHEN** the backend restarts
  and the task page reloads, **THEN** the prior transcript remains visible and,
  after automatic resume settles at `WAITING_FOR_INPUT`, the task is shown in
  the Turn Finished review bucket rather than Backlog or Running.
- **GIVEN** an extracted managed npm runtime is corrupt, **WHEN** the first
  explicit update attempt fails, **THEN** only that package's deterministic
  execution directory is invalidated, the update runs once more, and success
  is reported only after ACP initialization succeeds.
- **GIVEN** the targeted cache repair or retry also fails, **WHEN** the update
  job becomes terminal, **THEN** it reports the bounded failure and performs no
  additional retry or broad cache deletion.
- **GIVEN** a manual Resume request fails, **WHEN** the backend returns a
  descriptive error, **THEN** the recovery surface keeps that message visible
  and offers the applicable next actions.
- **GIVEN** automatic resume fails and read-only restore succeeds, **WHEN** the
  task view loads, **THEN** it shows the resume cause and states that the
  workspace is read-only.
- **GIVEN** automatic resume and read-only restore both fail, **WHEN** the task
  view loads, **THEN** it shows both failure causes.
- **GIVEN** navigation selects a session on another task while the prior
  task's automatic session-status request remains unresolved, **WHEN** the
  prior result arrives after the current request starts, **THEN** the current
  task ignores the prior result and does not show its recovery error.
- **GIVEN** navigation leaves a task-session pair and then returns to the same
  pair while the first request remains unresolved, **WHEN** the first result
  arrives after the return request starts, **THEN** the returned task ignores
  the obsolete result and keeps the return request's state.
- **GIVEN** the stored worktree branch is absent locally and on its configured
  remote, **WHEN** Resume fails, **THEN** the UI offers **Continue on a new
  branch** and does not run it automatically.
- **GIVEN** the user selects **Continue on a new branch**, **WHEN** recovery
  succeeds, **THEN** the same task session resumes through its stored provider
  identity on a unique branch from the configured base branch.
- **GIVEN** branch continuation succeeds, **WHEN** the chat reloads or replays
  events, **THEN** one warning identifies the old branch, new branch, and base
  branch and states that the old code was not recovered.
- **GIVEN** local and remote-tracking refs are absent but the configured remote
  still contains the branch, **WHEN** attach-only preflight runs, **THEN** it
  returns an ordinary reuse failure and does not advertise branch replacement.
- **GIVEN** attach-only preflight cannot authenticate to or reach the remote,
  **WHEN** the branch refs are absent locally, **THEN** it returns the probe
  failure and does not classify the branch as unrecoverable.
- **GIVEN** replacement checkout creation succeeds but the task-environment
  update fails, **WHEN** recovery returns, **THEN** no replacement checkout or
  branch remains and the prior environment record is unchanged.
- **GIVEN** replacement materializes before provider startup or readiness fails,
  **WHEN** the resume attempt reaches a terminal path, **THEN** one warning is
  persisted or remains retryable without changing the session identity.
- **GIVEN** an ACP worktree resume emits workspace preparation progress,
  **WHEN** preparation and agent reconnection finish successfully, **THEN** the
  preparation state becomes terminal and the idle chat shows neither
  **Preparing workspace** nor **Background work is running**.

## Out of scope

- Silently falling back to a fresh provider-native conversation after Resume.
- Reconstructing or rewriting provider-owned conversation history.
- Automatically mutating npm caches on every normal agent launch.
- Global npm cache cleanup, exact runtime-version pins, rollback, or selection
  of historical runtime versions.
- Relaxing credential-broker authorization for terminal sessions.
- Reconstructing commits, uncommitted files, or other code from a branch that
  no longer exists locally or on the configured remote.
- Automatic continuation on a new branch after branch loss.
- Branch replacement for an authentication, network, timeout, or other
  unconfirmed Git failure.
- New navigation, a new recovery page, or a new mobile-only recovery workflow.
