# Workflow quorum decision recording System Design



## Purpose and boundaries



The task system owns quorum semantics, participant canonicalization, decision persistence, guarded transition application, and diagnostic projections. The task-bound Office CLI and runtime API are transports over that engine-owned contract.

## Verified current state

The originating report named two causes. Only the first survives inspection.
Investigation surfaced four defects, three of which the report did not name.

### The evaluation path is intact (originally reported as broken)

`wait_for_quorum` **is** evaluated on the path that runs these workflows. The
claim that the orchestrator ignores the guard is false; the orchestrator
delegates to the engine, which owns the semantics.

| Link | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Guard evaluated on the transition loop | `apps/backend/internal/workflow/engine/engine.go:275` |
| All five thresholds implemented | `apps/backend/internal/workflow/engine/quorum.go:88-119` |
| Office dispatches into that engine | `apps/backend/internal/office/engine_dispatcher/dispatcher.go:108` |
| Office shares the orchestrator's engine instance | `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/main.go:1520,1527` |
| Participant + decision stores wired in production | `apps/backend/internal/backendapp/main.go:1514-1515` |
| `clear_decisions` / `queue_run_for_each_participant` callbacks wired | `apps/backend/internal/orchestrator/workflow_callbacks.go:49,56` |

The persistence layer is likewise complete: `RecordStepDecision` supersedes
prior verdicts inside a transaction (`phase2_sqlite.go:522-578`),
`ListStepDecisions` returns oldest-first (`:583-600`), and `AddTaskParticipant`
writes `decision_required = 1` for every reviewer and approver
(`office/repository/sqlite/participants.go:84-87`).

The engine's evaluation is therefore correct **given its inputs**. With zero
decision rows, `all_approve` and `any_reject` both correctly evaluate false and
the card correctly stays put. The defects are all on the input side.

### Transport follow-up — remove the per-turn decision schema

The first agent surface added `record_step_decision_kandev` to
`SurfaceOfficeTask`. That proved the server-owned decision and quorum path, but
it also makes every Office turn carry a decision JSON schema, including turns
whose agents do not occupy a reviewer or approver seat.

Office already uses a signed, task-bound runtime CLI for its mutation surface.
The final transport moves decision recording to that established path while
retaining `DashboardService.RecordAgentDecision` and the workflow engine as the
only business and transition path. The MCP registration, websocket transport,
and transport-only tests are removed only after the CLI, runtime endpoint, and
injected skill are covered.

### Defect 2 — the human path writes a verdict the evaluator cannot read

Office records `changes_requested` (`office/models/models.go:653`), surfaced in
the frontend contract as `"approved" | "changes_requested"`
(`apps/web/lib/api/domains/office-extended-api.ts:297`).

The evaluator counts only `approved` and `rejected`
(`workflow/engine/quorum.go:25-26,100-103`).

A human clicking **Request changes** therefore writes a row that satisfies
neither `all_approve` (it is not an approval) nor `any_reject` (it is not
literally `rejected`). The task stays at Review with a rejection on file. This
is live today on the human path and is independent of Defect 1.

The vocabulary is only half of it. `resolveParticipantID`
(`office/dashboard/decisions.go`) stamps every human decision with the constant
`userParticipantSentinel = "user"`, because the singleton user has no
`agent_profile_id` and therefore no `workflow_step_participants` row.
`latestDecisionsPerParticipant` (`workflow/engine/quorum.go`) discards any
decision whose `participant_id` is absent from the required slate, and that
slate is built from participant-row UUIDs. **A human decision is therefore
discarded before its verdict string is ever inspected.** Correcting the
vocabulary alone changes nothing on the human path; AC-TASKS-QUORUM-VERDICT-001.3 is what makes AC-TASKS-QUORUM-VERDICT-001.2
reachable.

### Defect 3 — recording a decision does not re-evaluate the transition

`recordTaskDecision` (`office/dashboard/decisions.go:225-265`) persists the row,
publishes `OfficeTaskDecisionRecorded`, logs activity, and queues follow-up
agent runs. It never re-evaluates the guarded transition.

`Engine.RecordParticipantDecision` (`workflow/engine/quorum.go:152-200`) does
exactly that re-evaluation and has **zero production callers** — only tests.

So even once a verdict is recorded with a vocabulary the evaluator understands,
the transition fires only if some unrelated turn later completes on that task.
When the reviewer has already finished, nothing re-triggers.

### Defect 4 — participant rows are pinned to the step they were attached at

`AddTaskParticipant` (`office/repository/sqlite/participants.go:59-88`) writes
`step_id` = the task's step *at attach time*. No code ever updates a
participant's `step_id`; the only `UPDATE workflow_step_participants` statements
in the tree touch `agent_profile_id`.

`requiredParticipants` filters on `state.CurrentStepID`
(`workflow/engine/quorum.go:70-83`). A participant attached at one step is
invisible at every other step, and an empty slate fails closed
(`quorum.go:57-60`).

Live evidence from the verified task — the approver exists only at Work:

| participant | step | role | decision_required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `afbd72cd` | Review | reviewer | 1 |
| `8eefba93` | **Work** | approver | 1 |
| `3cb7cd33` | Work | reviewer | 1 |

Review's reviewer slate is non-empty, so Defects 1–3 are what block this task
today. But Approval's approver slate is **empty**, so fixing Review alone moves
the card one step and strands it again.

Two further facts make this wider than the slate. First, `AddTaskParticipant`'s
idempotency probe is itself scoped to `step_id`, so re-attaching the same agent
after a step change **creates a second row** for the same
`(task_id, role, agent_profile_id)` — the two-row shape is how the live data
above came to exist, not a hypothetical. Second, `ListAllTaskParticipants`
(`office/repository/sqlite/participants.go`) is *also* step-scoped, so
`resolveDeciderRole` — the role-resolution precedent AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.4 cites — is blind in
exactly the same way: an approver whose row sits at Work cannot be resolved as
an approver while the task is at Approval. Slate membership, role resolution,
and the `participant_id` written on a decision must therefore all use one
canonical-row rule, which AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.3 defines.

### Defect 5 — every failure is silent and identical

The engine holds no logger (`workflow/engine/engine.go:131-144`) and `quorum.go`
emits nothing. `evaluateTransitionGuard` returns `(false, nil)` for all of:
store not wired, empty required slate, threshold genuinely unmet, and unknown
guard variant. From outside, a card legitimately awaiting two more approvals is
byte-for-byte identical to a card whose guard can never be satisfied. This is
the diagnostic gap that let the bug survive.

### Live workflow configuration

`Office Default` (`7561d51f`), steps Backlog(0) Work(1) Review(2) Approval(3)
Done(4). Both guarded steps carry the guard nested inside the action's `config`,
which `ConfigTransitionGuard` accepts (`workflow/engine/types.go:533`):

```json
"on_turn_complete": [
  {"type": "move_to_step", "config": {"step_id": "<Approval>",
     "wait_for_quorum": {"role": "reviewer", "threshold": "all_approve"}}},
  {"type": "move_to_step", "config": {"step_id": "<Work>",
     "wait_for_quorum": {"role": "reviewer", "threshold": "any_reject"}}}
]
```

Approval is the same shape with `role: approver`.

## Agent command contract

Pinned here because Build would otherwise invent it and Review would relitigate it.

**Command.** `$KANDEV_CLI kandev task decision --decision approved|rejected
--reason "..."`. The command is taught through the injected
`kandev-step-decision` system skill and repeated in the review and approval
stage prompts as the required final action.

**HTTP endpoint.** `POST /api/v1/office/runtime/task/decision` with a closed JSON
body containing only `decision` and `reason`. The route uses the existing
Office runtime bearer-token middleware and does not expose a task id in its
path. Identity-shaped body fields are rejected rather than ignored.

**Arguments.**

| Argument | Required | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `decision` | yes | `"approved"` or `"rejected"` |
| `reason` | yes | non-empty string |

No idempotency argument. A retry is a new verdict that supersedes the previous
one under AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.2; the command is deliberately NOT idempotent across calls, and
AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.7 states this as contract so a builder does not invent a client-supplied
key. Idempotency in this feature is confined to transition application
(AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.6, AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.4).

**Scoping.** The command and endpoint accept no task, step, role, participant,
session, or agent identifier. The runtime handler derives `task_id`,
`session_id`, and `agent_profile_id` from the validated signed Office run
context. `DashboardService.RecordAgentDecision` resolves the task's current
workflow step and the caller's canonical reviewer or approver seat live on
every call. A token bound to one task cannot address another task, and a caller
that no longer holds a decision seat is rejected without a write.

**Transport boundary.** The runtime handler remains thin. A small composition
adapter translates the runtime request and response types and calls
`DashboardService.RecordAgentDecision`; the dashboard service continues to own
validation order, decision publication, activity, reactivity, and delegation
to the workflow engine's decision path. The runtime layer does not implement a
second quorum or persistence path.

**Return.** On success the command returns exactly these seven fields, observed by
AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.11:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `decision` | the recorded verdict |
| `role` | the caller's resolved role, per AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.4 |
| `step_id` | the validated step the row landed on, per AC-TASKS-QUORUM-BINDING-001.2 |
| `decision_id` | the decision row id, per AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.8 |
| `decided_at` | the row's `decided_at` value as persisted |
| `transition_applied` | `true` meaning the task left the step, per AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.10 — NOT that it was admitted at the target |
| `guards` | the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.14 per-guard entries for the validated step, identical in shape to AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.4's |

The agent needs `transition_applied` to know whether its work at this step is
finished, and `step_id` to detect the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-BINDING-001.2 race in which its decision landed on
a step the task has since left. `decision_id` and `decided_at` are returned
because AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.12 requires `publishDecisionRecorded` to keep publishing
`decision_id` and `created_at` off the `DecisionRecord`, and once the persist
moves behind the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.10 entry point those two values are no longer office's to
generate.

There is deliberately NO scalar `required_count` / `received_count` pair. A step
may configure several guards, and AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.4's approver-wins precedence can resolve the
caller to `approver` while every guard at that step names `reviewer` — this happens
when both seats sit at the task's current `workflow_step_id`, which `Office
Default`'s Review reaches whenever a thin workspace seats one agent in both
roles there (AC-OFFICE-REVIEW-SEATS-002.4/002.5), per `## Live workflow
configuration`. A caller whose approver seat instead sits at an earlier step,
such as Work, now resolves to `reviewer` at Review under
AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.4's step-preferring rule and is counted
normally by that guard; approver-wins no longer reaches across steps. In the
same-step case, AC-TASKS-QUORUM-BINDING-001.7 means the decision is never
counted by that guard at all, so a single pair of counts is either ambiguous
or actively misleading. `guards` gives the agent the count against each guard
that exists, which is the question it was actually asking.

A third case reaches the same cross-step scan without either seat sitting at
the current step at all: both `AddTaskReviewer`/`AddTaskApprover` seats are
cast while the task sits on an earlier step (e.g. Backlog), so by the time
the task reaches Review neither seat's `StepID` matches `review`. The seats
can share that earlier step or come from two different earlier steps. Here
`ResolveParticipantRole` reads the role named by Review's own eligible
`wait_for_quorum` guard and prefers the matching seat — `reviewer`, in the
thin-workspace Review case — over the fixed approver-first order. This
guard-role tiebreak only applies when the current step names exactly one
role; a step naming both roles, naming neither, or that fails to load falls
back to approver-wins unchanged, so this case narrows rather than replaces
the existing precedence.

This precedence applies only to the agent decision surface. The human decision
path retains its existing `resolveDeciderRole` behavior and unconditional
approver precedence, as required by AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.4a. The two
paths can therefore persist different roles for the same caller, task, and
step. Future implementations must preserve this boundary.

**MCP boundary.** `record_step_decision_kandev` is absent from the
`SurfaceOfficeTask` registry and first-turn MCP inventory after this command is
wired. Normal Kanban profiles remain unchanged and never receive the Office
decision skill or CLI instruction.

**Reason column.** The reason is written to `workflow_step_decisions.comment`,
the column every Office reader already projects (`office/dashboard/decisions.go:141,428`).
It is NOT written to `note`, which `Engine.RecordParticipantDecision` currently
uses (`workflow/engine/quorum.go:180`) and which no Office surface reads. Any
engine-side decision API used by this feature writes `comment` for the
human-facing reason. A reason written only to `note` would be invisible in the
task timeline — this is the concrete bug this paragraph exists to prevent.

## Persistence guarantees

- A decision write and its supersede of the prior verdict are one transaction; a
  reader never observes zero non-superseded rows for a participant that has
  decided (existing `RecordStepDecision` behavior).
- A recorded decision survives a re-evaluation failure (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.3).
- Decisions cleared by `clear_decisions` on step re-entry are hard-deleted;
  decisions superseded by a new verdict are retained with `superseded_at` set —
  the existing split at `phase2_sqlite.go:686-697`.
- Threshold evaluation counts, per AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.9 seat, the LAST
  row under the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.1 ordering — it does not filter on `superseded_at`.
  `ListStepDecisions` deliberately returns superseded rows so timelines can
  render full history, and the engine's `DecisionInfo` projection carries no
  `SupersededAt` field, so the engine could not filter on it even if it wanted
  to. Last-row-wins and non-superseded coincide whenever the supersede predicate
  and the `participant_id` key agree; AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.3 is what makes them agree, and
  without it the two diverge exactly in the multi-row case of AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.4.

## Out of scope

Each of the following is a deliberate exclusion, not an oversight.

- **Workspace `approvals` subsystem.** `POST /approvals/:id/decide` and its
  `"approved" | "rejected"` shape (`apps/web/lib/api/domains/office-api.ts:534`)
  are a separate feature from task step decisions. The
  `agentctl kandev approvals decide` command remains untouched and is not reused.
- **New thresholds.** `all_approve`, `all_decide`, `any_reject`,
  `majority_approve`, `n_approve:<N>` are the complete set. No new threshold.
- **Guard variants beyond `wait_for_quorum`.** `TransitionGuard` stays
  single-variant.
- **`on_enter` action dispatch.** Tracked by its own card, and this feature does
  not change it. It is a **hard dependency**, not merely an adjacent card:
  AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.9's decision-clearing is what stops a rejection recorded at a guarded step
  from re-firing `any_reject` every time the task returns there, and the only
  `on_enter` trigger dispatch in the tree today is inside
  `SwitchWorkflowCallback`. AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REGRESSION-001.6 turns that dependency into an observable
  regression so it fails loudly instead of shipping as an unbounded
  reject/return loop. This feature SHALL NOT grow a second decision-clearing
  path to compensate.
- **Decision revocation.** A participant may supersede a verdict by recording a
  new one; there is no withdraw-to-undecided operation.
- **Timeouts and escalation.** A quorum that is never reached waits
  indefinitely. No auto-advance, no reminder, no deadline.
- **Delegating or reassigning a pending decision.** Not addressed.
- **Kanban-workflow decisions.** The decision command is Office-run only
  (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.9); Kanban keeps `step_complete_kandev` and
  its existing MCP profile.
- **Backfilling the zero existing decision rows.** There are none to migrate.
- **Client-supplied idempotency keys on the decision command.** Excluded by AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.7.
  Transition application is idempotent (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.6); recording is not.
- **Giving the singleton human user a participant row.** AC-TASKS-QUORUM-VERDICT-001.3 makes a human
  rejection count without one. Seating the user in the slate would change who
  `all_approve` waits for on every existing task, which is a larger contract
  change than this card carries.
- **The `allApproversApproved` / `pendingApprovers` close gate.** These drive the
  `task_ready_to_close` reactivity run and the `ApprovalsPendingError` 409 on
  `UpdateTaskStatus`, and they read through the same step-scoped
  `office/repository/sqlite` query, so they carry Defect 4's blindness: an
  approver attached at an earlier step is invisible to them. Excluded
  deliberately, and the consequence is stated rather than hidden — after this
  card, quorum can advance a task while that separate gate still blocks its
  close on an approver it cannot see. Folding it in would extend AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.9's slate
  to a second consumer with different semantics (per-role current-approval, not
  threshold arithmetic) on a card that AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.9 has already grown. It needs its own
  card.
  The residual is sharper than "quorum can advance a task while that gate still
  blocks", and is recorded in full so the follow-up card is scoped from fact: a
  task whose AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.4 entries all report `satisfied` renders as `clear` under
  AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.11 — the healthy rendering — and can still take a 409
  `ApprovalsPendingError` on close, naming an approver that nothing this card
  touches can help the operator locate, because that gate reads through the same
  step-scoped `ListAllTaskParticipants` query Defect 4 diagnoses. This card
  therefore converts one invisible stuck class into one visible-but-confusing
  class, which is an improvement but not a completion. The follow-up should be
  tracked, not deferred indefinitely.
- **Repointing `resolveDeciderRole` for non-decision callers.** AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.5 fixes role
  resolution on the decision path only. Other readers of
  `ListAllTaskParticipants` keep today's step-scoped behavior.
- **A generic transition-lock primitive.** AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.10 adds exactly one additive port
  method, used only by the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.4 quorum apply; `ApplyTransition` and every
  transition that uses it keep today's semantics, and the compare-and-swap reuses
  the transaction and the workspace/step locks
  `updateTaskWithWorkflowStepAdmission` already takes. No engine-wide locking
  mechanism, and no behavior change to any non-quorum transition.
- **Repointing already-attached participant rows.** AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.1 changes how the slate
  is *read*; whether existing rows are also rewritten is an implementation
  choice the plan may make either way, provided AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.1–AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.7 hold.

## E2E surfaces

User-visible surfaces this touches:

- Office task detail approval action bar (`approval-action-bar.tsx`) — the
  Request-changes path changes behavior under AC-TASKS-QUORUM-VERDICT-001.2.
- Office task board — a card at Review now advances on quorum (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REGRESSION-001.1, AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REGRESSION-001.2).
- `GET /api/v1/office/tasks/:id/quorum` — new read endpoint (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.4, AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.5),
  projecting the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.14 engine snapshot.
- Office task detail awaiting-decisions rendering (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.6), including the
  stuck-distinct rendering of `reevaluation_blocked` (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.12) and the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.11
  aggregation when two guards disagree.

E2E recommendation: one Playwright spec driving Work → Review → Approval with a
reviewer and an approver attached, asserting advance-on-approve, return-on-reject,
and the awaiting-decisions presentation of AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.6. The same spec covers AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REGRESSION-001.6 at
no extra cost: after the return-on-reject leg, drive the task back to the guarded
step and assert it does not immediately bounce again. Backend quorum arithmetic,
vocabulary, and concurrency are Go-test territory, not E2E.
