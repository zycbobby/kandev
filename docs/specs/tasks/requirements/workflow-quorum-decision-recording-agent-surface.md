# Agent decision recording Requirements



## Overview



An Office participant can submit a validated verdict with a reason, and the result is tied to the task and workflow step used for validation.

## Requirements


### REQ-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001: Agent decision recording



**Intent:** An Office participant can submit a validated verdict with a reason, and the result is tied to the task and workflow step used for validation.

#### Acceptance criteria

#### Recording a decision (agent surface)

- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.1:** WHEN an Office agent session is attached to the task's current step
  with role `reviewer` or `approver` and `decision_required = 1`, THE SYSTEM
  SHALL inject a Kandev skill and stage prompt that require the task-bound
  `$KANDEV_CLI kandev task decision` command as the agent's final action. The
  command SHALL accept a verdict of `approved` or `rejected` and a required
  non-empty reason.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.2:** WHEN that command is called with a valid verdict, THE SYSTEM SHALL write
  one row to `workflow_step_decisions` with `task_id` = the calling session's
  task, `step_id` = that task's current `workflow_step_id`, `role` = the
  caller's resolved role, `decider_type` = `agent`, `decider_id` = the caller's
  agent profile id, and `participant_id` = the id of the **seat** the participant occupies, as
  defined by AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.9 — that is, AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.3 canonicalization followed by AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.5 collapse,
  not AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.3 alone. The written `participant_id` SHALL be the same id
  the quorum evaluator uses for that participant in the required slate; a
  decision whose `participant_id` is not the canonical id is a defect, because
  `latestDecisionsPerParticipant` silently discards it.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.3:** WHEN the caller is not a participant on the task with
  `decision_required = 1` for `reviewer` or `approver`, THE SYSTEM SHALL reject
  the call with a permission error and write no row.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.4:** WHEN the caller holds both `reviewer` and `approver` seats at
  the task's current `workflow_step_id`, THE SYSTEM SHALL record the decision
  under `approver`. WHEN exactly one of those seats sits at the task's current
  `workflow_step_id`, THE SYSTEM SHALL record the decision under that seat's
  role and SHALL NOT apply approver-wins across steps. WHEN neither seat sits
  at the task's current `workflow_step_id`, whether both seats share one
  earlier step or the seats occupy different earlier steps, THE SYSTEM SHALL
  record the decision under the role named by the current step's own
  eligible automatic `on_turn_complete` `wait_for_quorum` guard, when that
  step names exactly one role; only WHEN the current step names both roles,
  names neither, or cannot be resolved SHALL approver-wins apply as the final
  tiebreak.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.4a:** THE SYSTEM SHALL apply
  AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.4 to the agent decision surface only. The human decision path
  resolves the role step-blind and retains unconditional approver-wins, so the
  two surfaces MAY record a caller holding both roles under different roles for
  the same task and step. This divergence is deliberate and is recorded here
  rather than left implicit.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.5:** THE SYSTEM SHALL resolve the caller's role over the same
  participant population that AC-TASKS-QUORUM-SLATE-001.9 builds, not over rows scoped to the
  task's current step alone. `ListAllTaskParticipants` is step-scoped today, so
  an approver attached at an earlier step is currently unresolvable at the step
  where the approval is due; role resolution and slate membership SHALL NOT
  disagree about who participates.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.6:** WHEN the command or its Office API receives a verdict other than `approved` or `rejected`,
  THE SYSTEM SHALL reject the call with a validation error and write no row.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.7:** WHEN the command or its Office API receives an empty or whitespace-only reason, THE SYSTEM SHALL reject
  the call with a validation error and write no row.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.8:** WHEN the task has no `workflow_step_id` bound, THE SYSTEM SHALL
  reject the call with an error naming the unbound step and write no row.
- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.9:** THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT expose decision MCP
  metadata, the Office decision skill, or Office decision instructions to a
  normal Kanban session. The task-bound command SHALL be available only inside
  a scheduler-prepared, signed Office run context.

- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.10:** THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the Office decision API's preconditions in this
  order: (1) the task has a bound `workflow_step_id` (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.8), (2) the caller
  resolves to a participant with `decision_required = 1` for `reviewer` or
  `approver` (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.3), (3) the verdict is `approved` or `rejected` (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.6), (4) the
  reason is non-empty (AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.7). The step check precedes the permission check
  because `AddTaskParticipant` silently no-ops when a task has no bound step
  (`office/repository/sqlite/participants.go`), so an unbound-step task has zero
  participant rows **by construction**; a permission-first implementation would
  report AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.3's opaque permission error on the most likely real trigger for AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.8,
  a task created before a workflow step was assigned. The order is stated because
  both preconditions are false at once in that case and the two errors differ in
  diagnostic value.

- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.11:** WHEN the decision command returns successfully, THE SYSTEM SHALL return
  the seven fields enumerated in the system design's agent command contract: `decision`, `role`,
  `step_id`, `decision_id`, `decided_at`, `transition_applied` and `guards` —
  and SHALL NOT return a scalar `required_count` or `received_count`.
  `guards` SHALL equal the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.14 snapshot's `Guards` for the validated step,
  in the same order, so the tool and the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.4 endpoint report the same
  arithmetic. `guards` SHALL be an empty list, not an error and not omitted,
  when the validated step configures no guarded transition.
  WHEN the post-write AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.14 snapshot cannot be computed — the AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.3 case, where
  the write succeeded and the re-evaluation errored — THE SYSTEM SHALL return
  `guards` as an empty list and `transition_applied` as `false`, and SHALL still
  report the call as successful per AC-TASKS-QUORUM-REEVALUATION-001.3, the failure being surfaced through
  AC-TASKS-QUORUM-DIAGNOSTICS-001.2 rather than to the agent. A diagnostic read that failed SHALL NOT put the
  recorded verdict at risk.
  This AC exists because without it only two of the returned fields — `step_id`
  and `transition_applied`, via AC-TASKS-QUORUM-BINDING-001.2 and AC-TASKS-QUORUM-CONCURRENCY-001.4 — were observable by any
  acceptance criterion, so a wrong `role` or a wrong count could ship untested.

- **AC-TASKS-QUORUM-RECORDING-001.12:** WHEN an Office session lists its MCP
  tools after the CLI migration, THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT include
  `record_step_decision_kandev` or its JSON schema. Normal Kanban MCP profiles
  SHALL remain unchanged by this migration.

## Out of scope



Behavior outside this acceptance-criteria group is defined by the core quorum requirement and the other quorum capability requirements.
