# Specification catalog

This catalog is the entry point for the system-oriented specification layout. Each system README defines ownership, exclusions, and links to its canonical requirements and system designs.

## Migration record

The legacy specification sources were migrated from the unstructured root and category directories into the system-oriented layout. Task and workflow sources from PR #2957 remain under `tasks/`; three task-owned sources found outside that tree were folded into the same system during this migration.

---

The former legacy size exceptions for migrated sources were removed. All canonical requirement and system-design documents now pass the repository specification linter.

## Unmigrated additions

The following specifications were added after this migration and remain in the legacy layout until they move into an owning system:

- [Task Cost & Token Ledger](task-cost-ledger/spec.md) (draft)
- [Multi-tenancy](multi-tenancy/spec.md) (draft)
- [Startup listener before recovery](startup-listener-before-recovery/spec.md) (draft)
- [Workflow on_enter action dispatch](workflow-on-enter-action-dispatch/spec.md) (draft)
- [Kubernetes Executor](kubernetes-executor/spec.md) (implemented)
- [Task Delivery Ledger](task-delivery-ledger/spec.md) (draft)
- [Waiting Attribution](disambiguate-waiting/spec.md) (implemented)
- [ACP Form Elicitation](acp-elicitation/spec.md) (draft)
- [Parked-Session Notification Deferral](parked-notification-deferral/spec.md) (draft)
- [Workflow Engine Operation Ledger Lifetime](workflow-engine-operation-ledger-lifetime/spec.md) (draft)

## Authoring rule

- **Spec layout.** Umbrella specs live as flat `.md` files under the umbrella directory (`docs/specs/office/agents.md`). Standalone specs use a folder (`docs/specs/improve-kandev/spec.md`).
- **Plans are not specs.** Implementation plans are committed under `docs/plans/<feature>/` with individual sibling task files named `task-<NN>-<short-slug>.md`. Specs are the durable requirements; plans and task files are implementation records for the current buildout.
- **Bug fixes are not specs.** Bugs produce a regression test plus an ADR if they encoded a new convention. See `/fix` skill.
- **Architecture decisions are not specs.** ADRs live under `docs/decisions/`. See `/record decision`.
