## Migrated source detail

## Why

Today, settings-style operational concerns (health, disk usage, current version, OSS attribution, log access, database maintenance) have no home in kandev's UI. The existing settings sidebar is product-configuration only (executors, agents, integrations); the only system-shaped entry — Changelog — sits awkwardly inside it. When something goes wrong, users have no path inside the app to see "where is my database, how big is it, what version am I on, is there an update, where are the logs." This forces them into the filesystem and into GitHub, and it makes recoverable problems (bloated SQLite, corrupt state) look unrecoverable.

Radarr and Sonarr solve this with a dedicated **System** area: a group of read-only diagnostic pages plus a small number of gated maintenance actions. This spec brings the same shape to kandev, scoped to the kandev-specific surface (database diagnostics, SQLite backups/maintenance, worktrees, GitHub releases, and daily backend log files).

## What (v1)

A new **System** group is added to the existing settings sidebar (`apps/web/components/settings/settings-app-sidebar.tsx`), alongside General/Workspaces/Agents/Executors/Integrations/etc. The group contains nine child pages, each on its own route under `/settings/system/*`. The existing `/settings/changelog` route is removed and its UI is absorbed into the new **Updates** page.

### Pages

1. **Status** — `/settings/system/status`
   - **Health issues** card: renders the existing `GET /api/v1/system/health` payload (warning/error/info issues with messages and links).
   - **Disk usage** card: shows total kandev data footprint with a per-subdirectory breakdown (`data dir / worktrees / repos / sessions / tasks / quick-chat / backups`), an "as of HH:MM" timestamp, and a **Refresh** button. The disk walk is lazy and asynchronous: the first visit after a cold start (or after the 2h cache expires) returns `null` immediately and the page shows a loading spinner while the walk runs in the background; subsequent visits within 2h return the cached value instantly.
   - **Version + update** card: short summary of current version and "update available" badge, with a CTA to the Updates page.
2. **Feature Toggles** — `/settings/system/feature-toggles`
   - Install-wide runtime flags, risk metadata, environment locks, and restart handling.
   - The full contract lives in [Feature Toggles](../../platform/requirements/feature-toggles.md).
3. **Database** — `/settings/system/database`
   - Read-only: database driver, database size, and schema version. SQLite additionally shows the configured file path, WAL size, and last-backup timestamp from the sibling `backups/` directory. Postgres shows database-level size and does not render SQLite file/WAL/backup rows.
   - SQLite-only **VACUUM** button — safe, reclaims space; shows progress and final size delta.
   - SQLite-only **Optimize** button — runs `PRAGMA optimize`; shows progress.
   - SQLite-only **Factory Reset** button. This action is destructive.
     - It wipes the database, worktrees, repository clones, session directories, task directories, and Quick Chat directories.
     - The modal requires the literal string `RESET`. The user also acknowledges the pre-reset snapshot and required restart.
     - The server stops active work and creates `<database-dir>/backups/pre-reset-<ts>.db`.
     - The server drops the database tables, runs migrations, removes managed directories, and restarts.
     - The frontend disables the UI and waits for the backend. It then shows the empty onboarding state.
4. **Backups** — `/settings/system/backups`
   - Lists existing snapshots in `<database-dir>/backups/` with name, size, and mtime. `<database-dir>` is the parent of the configured SQLite database path.
   - Per-row actions: **Download**, **Restore** (gated like Factory Reset), **Delete** (confirm-only).
   - **Create snapshot** button at the top of the list; uses the existing `VACUUM INTO` path.
5. **Logs** — `/settings/system/logs`
   - One **Customize bundle** action that opens source selection with backend
     and frontend evidence selected by default; the runtime index and
     debug-only ACP evidence remain explicit opt-ins. Bundle collection keeps
     collecting/preparing/partial/busy/error feedback on the page.
   - Visible disclosure that the ZIP contains up to three days of install-wide
     backend logs and up to four connected browser profiles subject to fixed
     byte limits, including URLs, console arguments, stacks, and runtime
     metadata.
   - The page does not render a tail, file table, copy/refresh controls, or individual-file downloads.
   - If a source is unavailable, truncated by the fixed diagnostic budgets, or
     reports queue loss, the page still downloads a partial ZIP and names the
     omission without blocking normal application work.
   - The active files, browser capture, ZIP lifecycle, sink thresholds, and
     frontend-error ingestion contracts are defined by
     [Diagnostic logging](../../platform/requirements/diagnostic-logging.md).
6. **Updates** — `/settings/system/updates`
   - Shows running version, latest available version, and a "new version available" badge if newer.
   - **Check now** button — forces a re-poll (rate-limited 30s per process).
   - **Update channel** — Stable is the install-wide default. A verified managed npm/npx user
     service can select Nightly through the shared Settings save flow. Desktop, Homebrew,
     unmanaged, system-service, local, and unknown installs remain Stable with a visible reason.
   - A service update keeps its progress surface while the backend restarts. Once `/system/info` confirms the target version, the page reloads the document so the tab runs the new frontend bundle.
   - Update alerts are configured with the existing provider/event matrix under
     **Settings > General > Notifications**. The Updates page does not own a
     second notification enable switch or delivery-channel preference.
   - Below: the embedded changelog list (the content currently rendered at `/settings/changelog` via `@/generated/changelog.json`).
7. **Licenses** — `/settings/system/licenses`
   - Renders a JSON manifest of all third-party OSS dependencies (npm + Go), each with its license name, version, repository URL, and license text. The manifest is generated at build time and committed to the repo.
   - Searchable list (filter by package name or license type), one-line per row, expand to see full license text.
8. **Storage** — `/settings/system/storage`
   - Analyzes Kandev task workspaces, quarantine, managed Go cache, and Docker storage.
   - Configures opt-in idle-time maintenance and exposes manual analyze/run actions.
   - Lists cleanup history and restorable quarantined task workspaces.
   - The full ownership, API, persistence, and safety contract lives in
     [Storage Maintenance](../requirements/storage-maintenance.md).
9. **About** — `/settings/system/about`
   - Version, build commit, build timestamp, Go runtime version, Node runtime version, OS/arch.
   - Links: GitHub repo, documentation, license, "Report an issue".

### Sidebar badge

The **System** group header (and the **Status** child entry) show a numeric badge equal to `count(health.issues where severity != info) + (updateAvailable ? 1 : 0)`. The badge is sourced from the existing `useSystemHealth` hook plus the new updates hook; no new WS topic is required for v1.

### Backend surface

A new package `apps/backend/internal/system/` owns these endpoints. It absorbs the existing
`internal/health/` package as a sub-component. Read routes use the normal authenticated install
identity; selected mutation routes use the existing admin guard. See [Permissions](#permissions)
for the exact split and destructive-action confirmation pattern.

```

The System API has no global casing convention. Updates and Info use the snake_case JSON fields
shown above, while endpoints such as Disk Usage and Database use their documented camelCase
fields. Earlier camelCase Updates names in this draft (`latestCheckedAt`, `releaseUrl`, and
`applySupported`) were documentation errors, corrected here without renaming any wire field.

Storage endpoints are defined separately in [Storage Maintenance](../requirements/storage-maintenance.md).

Long-running operations (vacuum, optimize, reset, restore, snapshot create, disk walk) return `202 Accepted` with a `jobId` and publish progress on the existing event bus. The frontend subscribes via WS (`system.job.update` event) to render progress and final result. On success/failure the operation flips a corresponding entry in the existing health surface (e.g., a "VACUUM completed: reclaimed X MB" info issue that auto-expires).

### Updates poller

A background goroutine in `internal/system/updates/poller.go` starts on backend boot and polls the
selected channel every 6 hours. Stable reads GitHub Releases for `kdlbs/kandev`; Nightly reads the
public npm `kandev@nightly` dist-tag. It persists isolated channel targets in `kandev_meta`:

- `latest_version TEXT` — highest published semver tag (e.g., `1.2.4`)
- `latest_version_url TEXT` — URL to that GitHub release
- `latest_version_checked_at INTEGER` — unix timestamp of last successful poll
- `latest_version_nightly`, `latest_version_nightly_url`,
  `latest_version_nightly_checked_at` — equivalent npm Nightly cache keys

The `GET /api/v1/system/updates` handler reads from `kandev_meta` only; it never contacts an
upstream synchronously. Its nested `install` object reports the current service install state
(`running_as_service`, `managed_service`, `mode`, `manager`, `kind`, and `metadata_path`) so the UI
can decide whether one-click apply is allowed. The response's `channel` is the effective selected
source for this install. Only a
verified managed npm/npx user service can persist and expose Nightly; unsupported installs report
Stable even if an old Nightly preference remains stored, set `channel_editable=false`, and include
`channel_unsupported_reason`. The PATCH write path repeats the managed-service verification before
resolving or persisting either channel and returns `409 Conflict` for an unsupported install.
`channel_unsupported_reason` remains present with an empty string when channel editing is supported.
`POST /api/v1/system/updates/check` triggers a selected-source refresh, rate-limited
per-process to one call per 30 seconds. If the GitHub or npm call fails (offline, rate limited,
5xx), the channel's last-known value remains cached and `latest_checked_at` exposes the staleness.

`POST /api/v1/system/updates/apply` is available only when Kandev is running as a kandev-managed user service (`systemd --user` or launchd user agent) and the selected channel exposes an applicable target. The request includes the exact `target_version` shown to the user. While holding the update-cache lock, the backend rejects a stale target with `409 Conflict`; otherwise it writes that version to an update intent under `<KANDEV_HOME_DIR>/service/update-intents/`, starts a manager-owned helper (`systemd-run --user` on Linux, or a one-shot transient LaunchAgent plist bootstrapped via `launchctl bootstrap` on macOS), and returns a `self-update` system job id. Under `KANDEV_E2E_MOCK=true`, the helper path is fake so UI and backend tests can exercise the flow without mutating npm/Homebrew or restarting the service.

### Disk-usage cache

Cache is an in-memory `{ value *Breakdown, computedAt time.Time, computing bool }` guarded by a mutex. The walk is lazy — never runs at boot. `GET /api/v1/system/disk-usage` returns immediately:

- If `value == nil && !computing` → start the walk in a goroutine, return `{ data: null, computing: true }`.
- If `value == nil && computing` → return `{ data: null, computing: true }`.
- If `value != nil && time.Since(computedAt) < 2h` → return `{ data: value, computing: false }`.
- If `value != nil && time.Since(computedAt) >= 2h` → return `{ data: value, computing: true }` and start a background refresh.

`POST /api/v1/system/disk-usage/refresh` forces a refresh regardless of TTL. The job publishes a `system.job.update` event so the frontend can swap the cached value for the fresh one without polling.

### Licenses generation

Generation is **lockfile-driven and committed to the repo**. The file is read statically in dev, build, prod, and release with zero runtime cost and no network access.

- **Generator:** `apps/web/scripts/generate-licenses.ts` — pure function of two inputs.
  - npm side: walks `pnpm-lock.yaml` via `license-checker-rseidelsohn` (or equivalent), capturing `{ name, version, licenses, repository, licenseFile }` per package.
  - Go side: resolves modules from `apps/backend/go.sum` via `go-licenses report` (or by reading vendored LICENSE files), captured into the same shape.
  - If `go-licenses` is present but fails without producing a usable report, the generator reuses valid committed Go entries and marks them with `stale: true`; the Licenses page surfaces a stale-data warning for those entries.
  - Output: `apps/web/generated/licenses.json`, **committed to git**.
- **Local trigger:** `pnpm licenses:gen` — devs run it after a dep bump.
- **CI gate:** A workflow step in `.github/workflows/` runs the generator and warns if the result differs from the committed file. This surfaces license drift whenever `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `go.sum` changes, without requiring it to run on every `pnpm build`.

The page reads the JSON statically; no backend endpoint is needed.

## Scenarios

- **GIVEN** a user opens `/settings/system/status` for the first time after backend boot, **WHEN** the page mounts, **THEN** the Disk Usage card shows a spinner and "Calculating…", the backend kicks off the walk, and the value populates within seconds without further interaction (via WS job update or 5s poll fallback).
- **GIVEN** the disk-usage cache is 30 minutes old, **WHEN** the user reopens the Status page, **THEN** the cached value renders instantly with "as of <30 min ago>" and **no** refresh kicks off.
- **GIVEN** the disk-usage cache is 3 hours old, **WHEN** the user reopens the Status page, **THEN** the stale value renders immediately, the page badge shows "Refreshing…", and the value updates when the background walk completes.
- **GIVEN** the user is on `1.2.3` and the GitHub latest release is `1.2.4`, **WHEN** they open `/settings/system/updates`, **THEN** an "Update available" badge renders next to the version, the changelog list shows `1.2.4` highlighted as the new entry, and the System sidebar group shows a `1` badge.
- **GIVEN** the user wants to change update-alert delivery, **WHEN** they open
  `/settings/system/updates`, **THEN** the page directs them to the existing
  Notifications provider/event settings instead of rendering a separate
  update-notification channel control.
- **GIVEN** the user is running a kandev-managed user service and a newer release exists, **WHEN** they open `/settings/system/updates`, **THEN** the page shows **Apply update** and the confirmation queues a `self-update` job.
- **GIVEN** the user runs a verified managed npm/npx user service, **WHEN** they select and save
  Nightly, **THEN** the choice survives reload and update discovery follows `kandev@nightly`.
- **GIVEN** the install is Desktop, Homebrew, unmanaged, system-service, local, or unknown,
  **WHEN** Updates renders, **THEN** Stable remains effective and Nightly shows a visible
  unsupported reason.
- **GIVEN** a service update is in progress, **WHEN** `/system/info` first reports the requested target version, **THEN** the tab reloads exactly once and renders from the confirmed backend's frontend assets; an older version or temporary outage does not trigger the reload.
- **GIVEN** the user is not running as a kandev-managed service or is running a `--system` service, **WHEN** they open `/settings/system/updates`, **THEN** the page does not render an update-apply control and instead shows the manual update commands.
- **GIVEN** the user clicks **VACUUM** on the Database page, **WHEN** the operation completes, **THEN** the DB size delta is shown ("Reclaimed 12.3 MB"), the page Database stats refresh, and a transient info issue appears on the Status page.
- **GIVEN** the backend uses Postgres, **WHEN** the user opens the Database page, **THEN** the page shows the PostgreSQL driver and database size without issuing SQLite-only PRAGMA queries, and SQLite-only maintenance controls are not rendered.
- **GIVEN** the user clicks **Factory Reset**, types `RESET`, and confirms, **WHEN** the backend executes, **THEN** a fresh snapshot is created first, all tables are dropped and migrations re-run, the backend restarts, and the frontend redirects to the empty onboarding state once it reconnects.
- **GIVEN** `KANDEV_DATABASE_PATH` points to `<custom>/named.db`, **WHEN** the user opens Database and Backups, **THEN** Database reports that exact path and Backups lists snapshots from `<custom>/backups/`.
- **GIVEN** `KANDEV_DATABASE_PATH` points to `<custom>/named.db`, **WHEN** a restore succeeds, **THEN** Kandev stages `<custom>/named.db.new`, stops active executions, closes the SQLite pool, removes stale WAL sidecars, and replaces `<custom>/named.db`.
- **GIVEN** a snapshot exists only in the old default directory, **WHEN** a custom database path is active, **THEN** Kandev does not list or move it.
- **GIVEN** the backend cannot reach GitHub, **WHEN** the poller fires, **THEN** the failure is logged but the previous `latest_version` and `latest_version_checked_at` remain in `kandev_meta`; the Updates page surfaces the stale value with a "Last checked <time>" subtitle.
- **GIVEN** the user clicks **Check now** twice within 30 seconds, **WHEN** the second click fires, **THEN** the endpoint returns `429 Too Many Requests` and the UI shows "Already checked, try again in <N>s".
- **GIVEN** retained backend logs and a connected browser with local console history, **WHEN** the user downloads diagnostics from `/settings/system/logs`, **THEN** one ZIP contains separate backend/frontend directories and a manifest describing both captures.
- **GIVEN** the user opens `/settings/system/licenses` while offline, **WHEN** the page renders, **THEN** every dependency's license text is available locally (no network calls).
- **GIVEN** no queue-limit environment variable is set, **WHEN** an admin saves
  a new limit on `/settings/general/message-queue`, **THEN** later queue
  admissions use it immediately without deleting existing messages or
  requiring a restart.

## Data model

The existing key/value `kandev_meta` table stores stable target keys `latest_version`,
`latest_version_url`, and `latest_version_checked_at`. Nightly uses the isolated keys
`latest_version_nightly`, `latest_version_nightly_url`, and
`latest_version_nightly_checked_at`. The install-wide `settings` table contains
`updates_channel` with value `stable` or `nightly`; missing or invalid values read as Stable.
No new SQLite table is required.

## State machine — long-running jobs

Jobs (vacuum, optimize, reset, restore, snapshot create, disk walk) progress through:

```
queued → running → succeeded
                 ↘ failed
```

Each transition publishes `system.job.update` with `{ jobId, kind, state, message, result? }` on the event bus. Reset and restore additionally emit a `system.restart.pending` event that the frontend uses to switch into a "waiting for backend" state.

## Permissions

System read endpoints use the normal authenticated/synthetic install identity. The existing admin
guard covers database vacuum/optimize/reset, manual update checks, update-channel changes, and
update apply. Backup create/restore/delete and disk-usage
refresh currently remain on the base authenticated group. Reset and restore additionally validate
their confirmation bodies server-side as defence in depth.
The Message Queue settings GET is readable by members, while its PATCH is admin-only.

## Failure modes

- **GitHub poll failure** — log + keep the previous `kandev_meta` row; `/api/v1/system/updates` returns the stale value.
- **npm Nightly poll failure** — log + keep the previous Nightly cache; malformed or missing
  `dist-tags.nightly` fails closed and is never offered.
- **Disk walk failure** (permission error on a subdir) — return the partial result with a `warnings: [...]` array per subdir; the page renders a per-row warning icon.
- **VACUUM failure** — DB is unaffected (VACUUM is atomic); the job ends `failed` with the SQLite error string. Status page shows a recoverable error issue.
- **Non-SQLite maintenance call** — `vacuum`, `optimize`, and `reset` jobs fail with `not supported for <driver> driver` before running SQLite-only SQL; factory reset also rejects before stopping active executions.
- **Factory reset failure mid-run** — the pre-reset snapshot remains in the sibling SQLite backup directory. The user can restore it from the Backups page on the next boot. Recovery is documented inline in the failure UI.
- **Restore failure** — the original DB file and SQLite sidecars remain available when checkpointing is busy, and are restored from quarantine when replacement fails; restore stages the snapshot, validates the checkpoint result, quarantines the originals, and rolls them back if installation fails. PostgreSQL restore is rejected before staging or shutdown.
- **Log file missing / unreadable** — bundle creation continues with available
  sources, marks the result partial, and records the missing/unreadable backend
  source in `manifest.json`.

## Persistence guarantees

- `kandev_meta` writes are SQLite-atomic.
- The SQLite backup directory is `backups/` under the parent of the configured database path. The default remains `<home>/data/backups/`.
- Snapshot files in the SQLite backup directory are created via `VACUUM INTO <tmp>` then atomic-renamed. Partial files cannot appear.
- Restore writes the snapshot to `<configured-database-path>.new`, stops scheduling, active executions, and database-backed workers, checkpoints and closes the SQLite pool, then quarantines the main file and `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars before installing the staged file. A failed replacement restores the quarantine. The frontend requires an immediate backend restart before database-backed work resumes.
- Kandev does not migrate snapshots from another backup directory. It cannot prove that those files belong to the configured database.
- The existing boot-time backup retention (newest 2) is preserved, but **only auto-snapshots are subject to it**. Snapshots are distinguished by filename prefix:
  - `kandev-<version>-<ts>.db` — created automatically on a version-change boot or as the pre-reset snapshot before factory reset. Pruned by the existing "keep newest 2" rule (operating only on files with the `kandev-` prefix).
  - `manual-<ts>.db` — created by the user clicking **Create snapshot** in the Backups page. Never auto-pruned; lives until the user deletes it explicitly from the same page.
- Existing snapshots are not renamed or moved. Kandev cannot verify that an unprefixed or legacy snapshot belongs to the active configured database.
