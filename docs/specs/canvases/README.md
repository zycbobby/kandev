# Canvases

Canvases own agent-authored task applications and their promotion to workspace
applications. The system owns canvas scope, source lineage, release selection,
editing sessions, and discovery.

The Plugins system owns the isolated web-application runtime, permissions,
Kandev data access, state, events, and package validation. The task system
remains authoritative for task data and permissions.
