# Agent-authored web-app canvases Requirements

## Overview

A canvas is a custom web application that an agent creates for one task. A
user can promote a useful task canvas to its workspace. A workspace canvas
appears in workspace navigation and can use workspace-scoped data.

The Canvases system owns the canvas scope, source lineage, release selection,
promotion, editing flow, and discovery. The Plugins system owns the isolated
web-application runtime and its data contract.

## Terminology

- **Task canvas:** A canvas that belongs to one task and appears only in that
  task.
- **Workspace canvas:** A promoted canvas that belongs to one workspace and
  appears in workspace navigation.
- **Draft:** Editable canvas source in an authorized agent workspace.
- **Release:** An immutable package that passed validation.
- **Promotion:** A user action that changes a task canvas to workspace scope.

## Requirements

### REQ-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001: Agent-created task canvas

**Intent:** A task agent creates a purpose-built interface without requiring a
person to assemble predefined blocks.

**User story:** As a user, I want a task agent to create a custom interface for
the task, so that the interface matches the work.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.1:** When a user requests a canvas from a
  task, the active task agent shall create the canvas draft in that task
  context.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.2:** When the agent publishes a first
  release, the open task shall show its ready or permission-review canvas host
  without a browser reload or manual panel action.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.3:** When an agent session creates a canvas,
  the canvas shall belong to the trusted task and workspace from that session.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.4:** Agent input shall not select another
  task, workspace, user, or canvas owner.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.5:** The task interface shall not offer a
  blank manual canvas builder or predefined block editor.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.6:** When a task agent creates or edits a
  canvas, it shall be able to read the version-matched Kandev canvas-authoring
  skill without adding that skill to the task workspace.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.7:** When the canvas feature is disabled,
  Kandev shall not expose canvas tools, routes, events, background work, or user
  interface entries.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.8:** The authoring guidance shall provide a
  complete core workflow and exact file inventory with at most one required
  skill-read operation.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.9:** Local, container, and remote task
  agents shall use the same authoring contract without access to a Kandev host
  file path.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.10:** Canvas-capable task instructions shall
  identify the create, skill-read, and publish operations, including discovery
  guidance when those tools are not immediately callable.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.11:** Authoring instructions shall require
  creation in Kandev, edits inside the assigned source directory, and a publish
  result before a completion claim.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-001.12:** Authoring instructions shall distinguish
  an active release, a release awaiting permission review, and an unsuccessful
  publish. Local files or a successful build shall not imply publication.

### REQ-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-002: Durable source and releases

**Intent:** A published canvas remains available after the agent workspace and
browser session end.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-002.1:** After a browser reload and a backend
  restart, the canvas shall load the same active release.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-002.2:** When an agent publishes an invalid
  draft, the system shall preserve the current active release and show the
  validation errors.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-002.3:** When an agent publishes a valid draft,
  the system shall activate one immutable release and preserve one prior valid
  release for rollback.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-002.4:** When a user rolls back a release, the
  canvas shall activate the retained prior release without changing its scope
  or identity.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-002.5:** When a task is removed, the system shall
  remove its unpromoted canvases and preserve canvases that were promoted.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-002.6:** When a workspace is removed, the system
  shall remove all of its canvases, grants, state, runtime tokens, releases, and
  retained artifacts.

### REQ-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-003: User-controlled promotion

**Intent:** A useful task canvas becomes a workspace application only after a
user reviews its scope and permissions.

**User story:** As a user, I want to promote a useful task canvas, so that I
can open it from the workspace sidebar.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-003.1:** When a user starts promotion, the
  system shall show the requested data, write, event, state, and network
  permissions before confirmation.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-003.2:** When the user confirms promotion, the
  same canvas identity and active release shall change to workspace scope.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-003.3:** When promotion completes, the canvas
  shall appear in navigation for that workspace only.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-003.4:** An agent shall not promote, demote, or
  grant permissions to a canvas.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-003.5:** When a release requests new permissions,
  the current release shall remain active until a user approves the new set.

### REQ-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-004: Agent-assisted workspace editing

**Intent:** A person changes a workspace canvas by describing the change to an
agent instead of editing source in Kandev.

**User story:** As a user, I want an agent to edit a workspace canvas, so that
I do not need to maintain its source manually.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-004.1:** When a user selects Edit canvas, the
  system shall launch a Quick Chat agent with a draft of the active source.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-004.2:** The edit agent shall receive the canvas
  identity, current manifest, current source, validation rules, and existing
  permission grants.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-004.3:** Agent edits shall not change the active
  release until the publish operation succeeds.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-004.4:** When a Quick Chat edit session expires,
  the active and prior releases shall remain available.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-004.5:** When the edit adds permissions, the
  system shall use the permission review in
  `AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-003.5`.

  archived, disabled, invalid, or pending-permission canvases.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-005.4:** When a user opens a canvas from a task,
  the desktop task workbench shall show it in a canvas panel.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-005.5:** When a user opens a workspace canvas
  from navigation, the system shall show the same active release on its direct
  route.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-005.6:** Host controls for Edit, Promote,
  Permissions, Releases, Archive, and Remove shall remain outside canvas code.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-005.7:** When a user explicitly expands or
  folds the Canvases sidebar section, Kandev shall retain that preference.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-005.8:** When canvases are enabled, workspace
  settings shall show a Canvases tab and shall include the active canvas count
  in workspace summaries that have room for it.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-005.9:** A narrow workspace summary shall keep
  the Canvases tab available without compressing the summary tiles into
  unreadable labels.

### REQ-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-006: Responsive host surface

**Intent:** Desktop and phone users can open, manage, promote, and edit the same
canvas through native Kandev navigation.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-007.3:** When a canvas release becomes invalid or
  unavailable, the host shall show recovery actions without executing that
  release.
- **AC-CANVASES-AGENT-WEB-APPS-007.4:** A release history shall identify the

  steps. Tool identifiers shall remain exact in every locale.

  be able to read and edit the preset before submission. The submitted task
  shall retain those edits.

  authorized live Kandev data for domain views and report any required user
  permission review or workspace promotion.
