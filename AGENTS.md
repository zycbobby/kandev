```

## Tooling

- **Package manager**: `pnpm` workspace (run from `apps/`, not repo root)
- **Backend**: Go with Make (`make -C apps/backend test|lint|build`)
- **Launcher**: all four launch modes (`dev`, `start`, `run`, `service`) go through the native Go binary at `apps/backend/bin/kandev`; the launcher package is `apps/backend/internal/launcher`. `make dev` execs a copy of that binary (`bin/kandev-launcher`).
- **CLI**: `apps/cli` is the npm-published shim only (`bin/cli.js` + `bin/native-shim.js`); its tests run on the Node built-in test runner (`node --test`).
- **Frontend**: Vite/React SPA (`cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web dev|build:vite|lint`; for direct web typecheck use `cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck`)
- **Web-only scripts** live in `apps/web/package.json`; run them from `apps/web` (for example `pnpm run i18n:check` or `pnpm run i18n:ratchet`) or use `pnpm --filter @kandev/web ...`, not from `apps/`.
- **Desktop**: Tauri shell (`cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/desktop build|e2e`; Rust tests from `apps/desktop/src-tauri`)
- **UI**: Shadcn components via `@kandev/ui`
- **E2E**: Playwright (`cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:raw`). The `containers` project (gated on `KANDEV_E2E_CONTAINERS=1`, formerly `docker`) covers both the Docker executor and the SSH executor — anything that needs a real Docker daemon on the host lives there. See `apps/web/e2e/README.md`.
- **GitHub repo**: `https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev`
- **Container image**: `ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev` (GitHub Container Registry)

### Worktrees and commit hooks

A fresh git worktree shares `.git/` but **not** `apps/node_modules/`. The missing install breaks not just the commit-msg hook (`pnpm exec commitlint` → `Command "commitlint" not found` / `ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL`) but any pnpm command — `vitest` fails with `Failed to resolve import "vitest"`, eslint similarly. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` from `apps/` once after creating the worktree, before running tests/lint/commits; subsequent pnpm commands work normally.

## Scoped guidance

Architecture notes and per-area conventions live alongside the code they describe. Read the file in the directory you're working in:

- `apps/backend/AGENTS.md` — Go backend: package structure (incl. `internal/office/` and `internal/agent/runtime/`), key concepts (orchestrator, workflow engine, agent runtime, lifecycle manager), execution flow, provider pattern, backups, testing conventions, Go lint limits.
- `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/AGENTS.md` — agentctl HTTP server: route groups, adapter model, ACP protocol.
- `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/server/api/AGENTS.md` — reverse-proxy body rewriting (`Accept-Encoding`), iframe-blocking header stripping.
- `apps/backend/internal/integrations/AGENTS.md` — adding a new third-party integration (Jira/Linear pattern, both backend and frontend halves). The `/add-integration` skill mirrors this for scaffolding new integrations.
- `apps/desktop/AGENTS.md` — Tauri desktop app: runtime resources, Rust process lifecycle, packaging, signing, and smoke tests.
- `apps/web/AGENTS.md` — Vite/React SPA frontend: shadcn imports, Go boot-payload hydration, store slice structure (incl. `office`), WS format, component conventions, TS lint limits.

## Best Practices

### Engineering Principles

- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality without a clear reason.
- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.
- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.

### Commit Conventions (enforced by CI)

Commits to `main` **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`type: description`). PRs are squash-merged - the PR title becomes the commit, validated by CI. Changelog is auto-generated from these via git-cliff (`cliff.toml`). See `.agents/skills/commit/SKILL.md` for allowed types and examples.

The commitlint hook caps the header at **100 characters** (`type(scope): description`). The pre-commit prettier hook reformats staged TS/TSX files, and the `gofmt (backend)` hook can reformat staged Go files; if either hook changes files, the commit fails. Re-stage the reformatted files and create a new commit (don't `--amend`). Before committing, use `git diff --cached --name-only | grep '\.go$' | xargs gofmt -l`; run `gofmt -w` and re-add any files it reports.

### Release & Versioning

Stable Kandev releases use one **SemVer** `X.Y.Z` across npm, Homebrew, Scoop, GitHub Releases, Desktop, and containers. Scheduled npm-only Nightlies use `X.Y.(Z+1)-nightly.sha<12-hex>` without moving any Stable channel. Both flows run in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. A normal Stable release uses the protected `RELEASE_PR_BYPASS_TOKEN` environment secret only for its administrator PR merge. A Stable release is complete only after the GitHub Release, npm, Homebrew, and Scoop publications succeed and are verified. Full details are in the `/release` skill — load it when cutting a release, changing version channels, or debugging release artifacts.

### Code Quality

Static analysis runs in CI and pre-commit. Each subtree has its own thresholds:

- Go limits: see `apps/backend/AGENTS.md` (and `apps/backend/.golangci.yml`).
- TypeScript limits: see `apps/web/AGENTS.md` (and `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs`).

When you hit a limit: extract a helper function, custom hook, or sub-component. Prefer composition over growing a single function.

### Testing

Every code change must include tests for new or changed logic. Backend: `*_test.go` files alongside the source. Frontend: `*.test.ts` files for utility functions, hooks, API clients, and store slices. Exceptions: config files, generated code, React component markup. Use `/tdd` for test-driven development.

### Internationalization

The web UI is localized with i18next (`namespace:key`). **All new user-facing copy
must go through `t()` / `<Trans>`** — never a hardcoded literal — regardless of
which directory you are in.

This is enforced, not just requested, and the enforcement is now repo-wide:

- **`i18next/no-literal-string` is a lint error on every `.ts`/`.tsx` file**
  (tests and `e2e/` excluded). It was scoped to `i18nGuardFiles` while the
  migration was in flight; measured at zero violations across all 2560 source
  files, it was widened, so "the file was not on the list" is no longer a way for
  copy to ship untranslated.
- **`scripts/check-nonjsx-copy.mjs` scans the whole tree too**, by exclusion
  (`node_modules`, `dist`, `e2e`, `scripts`, `src/locales`, tests) rather than by
  allowlist, so a new directory is covered the day it is created.
- **New code, everywhere** — `pnpm run i18n:ratchet` (pre-commit + CI) fails on a
  hardcoded string in a file you added, or on a line you changed. Untouched lines
  are never judged.
- **`i18nGuardFiles`** (`apps/web/eslint.i18n.options.mjs`) survives as the
  migration record and the scope `pnpm run lint:i18n` previews. Append a path
  when you externalize one; never remove an entry — `check-guard-allowlist.mjs`
  rejects that.

Three rules that cause silent, hard-to-find bugs when broken: never translate a
string compared with `===` (type-to-confirm tokens become impossible to type);
never call `t()` at module scope (it freezes at the boot locale and the
pseudo-locale cannot detect it); never pass an English plural ending as a value —
use `count` with `_one`/`_other`. `pnpm run i18n:check` enforces the last two.

A clean lint is not proof a file is done: the rule only sees literals in JSX. The
positions it cannot inspect — SCREAMING_CASE config tables, plain `.ts` helpers,
parameter defaults, toast and setter arguments — are gated by
`scripts/check-nonjsx-copy.mjs`, which runs inside `pnpm run i18n:check` and the
new-code ratchet. Mark a genuine non-string (a persisted value, an agent-facing
prompt, a `===` token) with `// i18n-exempt: <reason>`; an unexplained marker
fails, and the marker must be a `//` line comment — the detector's pattern is
line-anchored and will not see one buried in a `/** */` block. The pseudo-locale
(Settings → General → Appearance, dev/e2e builds) is still the completeness check
for copy no literal scan can see.

**Translations gate the build.** `pt-pt`, `zh-cn`, `zh-hk` and `zh-tw` are
complete, and `check-i18n-keys.mjs` now fails on a missing key, an extra key, a
dropped placeholder, or a value left identical to English. Adding user-facing
copy means adding it in five languages; for the Traditional Chinese pair run
`pnpm run i18n:zh-hant` rather than hand-translating. When the correct
translation genuinely IS the English word, declare it in
`src/locales/<locale>/_verbatim.json` with a reason — brand nouns, acronyms and
placeholder-only frames need no declaration at all. Full guide:
[`docs/i18n.md`](docs/i18n.md).

UI punctuation is plain and intentional: do not use the Unicode em dash (U+2014)
in user-facing copy or locale values. Use a period, colon, comma, semicolon, or
parentheses instead. This applies to English, pseudo, and translated catalogs,
rendered fallback strings. `pnpm run i18n:check` enforces it. Historical
`CHANGELOG.md` entries are excluded because the changelog is generated release
history and remains immutable.

### Knowledge

- **Public docs:** Website-ready user documentation lives in `docs/public/**`. Use `/docs-maintainer` when a change affects CLI commands, config keys, install/deploy flows, workflows, executors, public APIs, screenshots, or user-facing terminology.
- **Specifications:** Durable product context, requirements, and system designs
  live under `docs/specs/**`. New work uses
  `docs/specs/<system>/requirements/` and
  `docs/specs/<system>/system-design/`. Read `docs/specs/README.md` and the
  relevant file in `docs/specs/guide/`. Use `docs/specs/INDEX.md` only to find
  unmigrated legacy specifications. Run `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py
  --all` after specification changes.
- **Decisions:** Architecture decisions are recorded in `docs/decisions/`. Read `docs/decisions/INDEX.md` for an overview. When making significant architectural choices, create a new ADR via `/record decision`.
- **Plans:** Implementation plans are generated from requirements and system
  designs through `/plan`. `docs/plans/<initiative>/plan.md` is a work-package
  manifest. Its sibling `task-<NN>-<short-slug>.md` files are work orders.

### Plan Implementation

- Requirements and system designs define durable behavior and technical
  boundaries. Plans and work orders define implementation scope, dependency
  order, and task-level validation. Keep their statuses and results accurate.

### Observability

- In dev mode (`KANDEV_MOCK_AGENT=true` or `debug.pprofEnabled`), `/debug/vars` exposes the stdlib expvar handler. Office provider-routing metrics live under `routing_*` (route attempts, fallbacks, parked runs, provider degraded/recovered counters). The metrics are also still emitted as structured `routing.metric.*` zap logs for human debugging.
- ADR 0015's step-completion-signal telemetry lives under `workflow_*`: `workflow_step_completion_signal_received_total` (`internal/workflow/signalmetrics/`), labelled by `source` and `agent_type`, counts accepted `step_complete_kandev` signals. Its separate `workflow_step_completion_signal_fallback_used_total` counter is labelled by `agent_type` and counts manual fallback uses. The fallback button does not have a production increment site yet, so the counter remains zero until that UI ships.

### GitHub Operations

Skills use `gh` CLI by default. If a `gh` command fails (not installed, not authenticated, etc.), use whatever GitHub tools are available in the environment (MCP GitHub tools, API tools, etc.) to accomplish the same operation. The goal is the same — the tool may differ.

For multiline Markdown issue or PR bodies, write the body to a file and pass it
with the relevant `gh ... --body-file <path>` option. Do not send escaped
newlines through `--body`; GitHub will render them literally.

For PR review/fixup workflows, prefer the repo helpers before manually querying GitHub/GraphQL: `scripts/pr-await <PR>` to block until CI is terminal and get one report (do not manually poll `pr-state` on a timer in the primary conversation; preserve the documented `pr-poller` fallback when `pr-await` is unavailable), `scripts/pr-state --summary <PR>` for checks and unresolved-thread state, `scripts/pr-state --comment <comment_id>` for a full review-comment body, `scripts/pr-resolve list <PR>` for actionable unresolved review threads, and `scripts/pr-resolve reply <PR> <comment_id> <thread_id> "<body>"` to reply, resolve, and react in one call.

When a Kandev system message references an MCP tool that is not visible in the active tool list, use the runtime's tool discovery mechanism, such as `tool_search` when available, before falling back to a less specific workflow. Some task messaging and platform helpers are exposed on demand.

### Single-Session Model Workflow

The user-started primary session owns durable artifacts, integration judgment,
and user communication. Platform-provided investigation and explorer agents
remain available. Launch planned native implementation subagents only after the
user explicitly authorizes them; this repository does not prescribe their roles
or model tiers.
The read-only `pr-poller` is the sole repository-defined exception: use it only
after the user explicitly asks to wait for or monitor PR updates.

Use the user's strong model for requirements, system designs, plans, work
orders, and high-risk design. When the user asks to proceed with feature
planning, produce all four artifact types as one design package. Pause after
requirements only when the user requests review or a material question blocks
planning.
At the completed-plan checkpoint, return control with a concise handoff. Do not
call `ask_user_question_kandev` (or an equivalent approval prompt) to ask the
user to approve the package or switch models. The user reviews the files,
switches the main session if desired, and sends a later explicit implementation
request. Detailed feature, fix, validation, and delegation routing lives in the
relevant skills, especially `planner-orchestration`.

Workflow-generated phase text such as `[IMPROVE PHASE]`, "implement the
requested change", TDD checklists, verification commands, or commit steps does
not opt a feature or behavior-changing fix out of spec-driven development. If
the request neither references an existing reviewed package nor explicitly asks
to implement a package created during a prior design turn, run
`spec-driven-development` through the plan/work-order checkpoint and stop before
production or permanent test changes. End that turn at the design-package
handoff; do not ask for approval or a model switch. A generic implementation
envelope is not an explicit opt-out; the user must either explicitly ask to
implement the created package in a later turn or explicitly say to skip
planning.

### Kandev Task Creation

Use Kandev task/session MCP APIs only when the user explicitly asks to create or
manage persistent Kandev platform tasks or sessions. Never use
`create_task_kandev`, `spawn_session_kandev`, or `message_task_kandev` as a
repository-work mechanism or fallback.

When the user explicitly requests related Kandev follow-up work, use
`create_task_kandev` with `parent_id: "self"`. That preserves workspace,
workflow, repository, agent profile, and executor context from the current
task. For genuinely unrelated top-level tasks, do not rely on workspace
defaults when the user expects continuity; explicitly preserve the current
task's `agent_profile_id` / `executor_profile_id`, or ask if the intended
profile is ambiguous.

When the user requests a persistent remediation task discovered during PR
review that must start after merge, create it with `parent_id: "self"`,
`workspace_mode: "new_workspace"`, and the reviewed PR's base branch; otherwise
a same-repository subtask inherits the reviewed branch. Set `start_agent: false`
when the follow-up is intentionally queued until merge.

### Third-party integrations

Jira and Linear are the model (per-workspace credentials, 90s auth-health poller via `internal/integrations/healthpoll`, settings page with status banner). New integrations should **reuse the shared shapes** rather than copying either. Full layout, file conventions, and Jira-vs-Linear divergence notes in `apps/backend/internal/integrations/AGENTS.md` and the `/add-integration` skill — load either when scaffolding a new integration.

### Kandev plugins

Production Kandev plugins live in dedicated repositories, not in this monorepo. Start at the [canonical plugin authoring guide](docs/public/plugins-authoring.md), then use `/create-kandev-plugin` for plugin creation, modification, bug fixes, packaging, release, and marketplace work. Official plugins use public `kdlbs/kandev-plugin-<slug>` repositories and start from [`kdlbs/kandev-plugin-template`](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev-plugin-template). The recommended workflow is: choose recipe → edit manifest → implement → validate → package → smoke test. When the user explicitly requests a persistent Kandev task, attach the plugin repository through that task's workflow; otherwise do not use Kandev task/session APIs as repository-work mechanisms.

Contract authority is intentionally split by implementation boundary: frontend authors use [`docs/plans/plugins/PLUGIN-API.md`](docs/plans/plugins/PLUGIN-API.md) plus [`apps/web/lib/plugins/types.ts`](apps/web/lib/plugins/types.ts), with concrete Host UI exports in `apps/web/lib/plugins/host-api.ts`; backend authors use `apps/backend/pkg/pluginsdk`, the wire contract in `apps/backend/proto/kandev/plugin/v1/plugin.proto`, and manifest/package rules in `apps/backend/internal/plugins/manifest` and `apps/backend/internal/plugins/pkgtar`. The in-tree fixture under `apps/backend/cmd/plugin-fixture` is test support, not a production plugin starter.

### Runtime profiles (prod / dev / e2e)

**`profiles.yaml` at the repo root** is the single source of truth for env-driven runtime defaults — feature flags, mock providers (agent / GitHub / Jira / Linear), debug switches, and e2e tuning knobs. The backend embeds it (`//go:embed` via `apps/backend/internal/profiles/`) and at startup calls `profiles.ApplyProfile()` to write the matching profile's env vars onto its own process, _only when each var is not already set_ — so launchers, shells, and per-spec overrides still win.

Runtime feature toggles add a SQLite-backed override tier managed through `Settings > System > Feature Toggles`. Effective values use this precedence: explicit environment variable > SQLite override > profile default. The typed runtime flag registry lives in `apps/backend/internal/runtimeflags/registry.go`; each registration owns the public metadata, environment variable, config reader, and config applier. Do not add parallel per-flag maps or switches.

Profile selection: `KANDEV_E2E_MOCK=true` → `e2e`, `KANDEV_DEBUG_DEV_MODE=true` or `KANDEV_DEBUG_PPROF_ENABLED=true` → `dev`, otherwise `prod`. The Go dev launcher (`apps/backend/internal/launcher/dev.go`) and `apps/web/e2e/fixtures/backend.ts` set only the selector — they no longer hardcode the underlying values.

Stable operator startup settings have a separate typed source contract in
`apps/backend/internal/common/config/catalog.go` and `source.go`. The catalog
owns each canonical YAML key, compatible environment alias, default, source
provenance, sensitivity, and reviewed exclusion. Configuration discovery uses
the first existing `config.yaml` candidate in working-directory, home, and
`/etc/kandev` order; it does not merge files. Environment values override YAML,
and consumers receive typed values or explicit child-process contracts instead
of relying on YAML-to-public-environment copying.

For any task that adds, rolls out, promotes, graduates, or removes a release toggle, use `/runtime-feature-flags`. That skill contains the file-by-file checklist, disabled-path requirements, test commands, promotion procedure, and retired-identity removal steps; do not rely on an agent discovering an ADR or public docs. In brief: merge risky features off in every shipped profile, enable a selected install with an admin override or explicit environment, restart when required by registry metadata, then test. Change `prod:` to `"true"` for the all-user release while retaining the registry entry as a kill-switch. Remove the live flag after the feature is permanent, move its key and environment variable to the append-only retired identities in `runtimeflags/registry.go`, and never reuse either identity. Completeness tests cover the registry/profile/frontend contracts. Runtime overrides and restart support are documented in `docs/decisions/0018-runtime-settings-overrides.md` and `docs/decisions/0019-restart-supervisor.md`.

## Maintaining This File

This file is read by AI coding agents (Claude Code via `CLAUDE.md` symlink, Codex via `AGENTS.md`). If your changes make any section of this file outdated or inaccurate - e.g., you add/remove/rename packages, change architectural patterns, add new adapters, modify store slices, or change conventions - **update the relevant sections of this file as part of the same PR**. Keep descriptions concise and factual. Do not add speculative or aspirational content.

When a change is scoped to a single subtree, update the scoped `AGENTS.md` instead of (or in addition to) this root file. See the "Scoped guidance" pointers at the top.

## Remote cloud environment

For developing in ephemeral cloud VMs (Cursor Cloud, Codex, GitHub Codespaces, etc.), see [`docs/remote-cloud-environment.md`](docs/remote-cloud-environment.md) — covers runtime requirements, generated-file gotchas, dev-mode setup, key commands, and Firecracker-specific caveats.

## Workflow routing (read on session start)

This repo uses `superpowers-bridge`: keep OpenSpec as the front door, and use Superpowers only as embedded capability inside OpenSpec stages.

### Entry routing

| Trigger | What to do |
|---|---|
| New feature / capability / architectural change | Use `/opsx:propose` with `--schema superpowers-bridge` |
| Already inside an active change | Use `/opsx:plan`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:archive` |
| Discussing ideas narratively | Use `superpowers:brainstorming`; write the outcome into `proposal.md` |
| Explicit bug fix / typo / tiny config tweak | Direct PR, no change |

### Hard rules

Do not create `brainstorm.md`, `plan.md`, or `retrospective.md`; do not write planning/design output to `docs/superpowers/specs/` or `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

### Archive policy

Merge conservatively by capability; prefer `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`; avoid new top-level capability folders unless necessary.
