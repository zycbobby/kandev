// planTruncationWarning renders the agent-facing warning appended to a plan
// write's tool result when the plan service reports TruncationDetected. It
// states plainly that the write replaced the entire document, names
// update_task_plan_kandev's mode="append" as the way to add a section
// without resubmitting the whole document, and names the prior revision
// number when it is known. This detector never runs on an append write
// (see plan_service.go), so every write it can flag was necessarily a
// replace.
//
// replacedRunes/newRunes are rune counts (not byte lengths): a script change
// (e.g. an ASCII plan rewritten in CJK) can retain a small fraction of the
// document's characters while retaining most of its bytes, so counting bytes
// would silently defeat this guard on exactly the kind of loss it exists to
// catch. Kandev ships zh-cn/zh-hk/zh-tw/pt-pt locales, so non-ASCII plan
// content is not hypothetical. The plan service computes these counts inside
// its write's critical section, off the content it actually replaced.
//
// priorRevisionNumber of 0 means the prior revision could not be established.
// The revision lookup can fail, or the latest revision can differ from the
// replaced HEAD because of historical divergence. Revision numbering starts
// at 1 (NextTaskPlanRevisionNumber), so 0 is never a real revision. In that
// case the warning does not make an unverified preservation claim.
//
// It deliberately does NOT tell the caller to "recover" the content by
// calling an MCP tool: none of the four registered plan tools can read a
// past revision (get_task_plan_kandev returns the current, now-truncated,
// HEAD). Telling an agent to "recover it" here would send it to the only
// tool it has, get back the truncated document, and fall back to
// reconstructing the plan from memory — the exact WO-38 failure this guard
// exists to stop. Instead it says where the content lives (revision
// history, Kandev UI only) and that the caller cannot fetch it itself, so
// the caller stops and surfaces the loss instead of guessing.
