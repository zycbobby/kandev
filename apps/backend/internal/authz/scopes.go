// Package authz owns Kandev's permission vocabulary: the named scopes that
// guard every user-facing action, the fixed roles that grant them, and the
// single resolver that answers "what may this user do in this workspace".
//
// There is deliberately one registry. Authorization used to be a single admin
// bit applied per route; a second mechanism living alongside the first is how
// permissions drift, so every guarded action names a scope from this file and
// nothing else decides.
