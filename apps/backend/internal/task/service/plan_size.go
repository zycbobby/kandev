// and injected into every session handover for its task, so an unbounded
// write lets one caller impose a repeated, unbounded cost on every later
// launch. The unit is bytes rather than runes on purpose: unlike
// planTruncationDetected, which counts runes because it reasons about how
// much of a document survived, this bounds memory and scan cost, which is
// proportional to bytes. Matches maxUserStateBodyBytes in
// internal/plugins/user_state_handlers.go.

// callers that need to report the actual numbers.
