// clarification_resolutions was a durable-claim table designed during this
// feature's spec review but retired before ever shipping in favor of
// upstream's CompleteActiveClarificationBundle (message-status based claim,
// see message_clarification_response.go). It never reached a released
// install, so there is no drop migration to run — the assertion here is
// simply that initSchema/runMigrations never create it, on a fresh database
// or a replayed one. The claim path itself has no statement of its own to
// assert against: CompleteActiveClarificationBundle is the only clarification
// claim in the repository package, enforced by the compiler once the retired
// repo/model files are gone (docs/specs/integrations/requirements/external-question-answering.md,
// P1).
