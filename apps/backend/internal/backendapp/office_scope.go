// Per-user scoping for Office HTTP routes.
//
// Office endpoints are dual-consumed: sandbox agents authenticate with a
// workspace-scoped JWT (validated and workspace-claim-checked by
// AgentAuthMiddleware, which sets an agent caller in context), while browser
// users authenticate with a session cookie and must own the target workspace.
//
// The first version of this middleware only understood `:wsId`, and its doc
// comment said so openly: "routes without a :wsId param ... remain governed by
// AgentAuthMiddleware". That premise was wrong for browser callers.
// AgentAuthMiddleware constrains only JWT callers, and every by-ID handler's
// own check is of the form `if caller := agentCallerFromCtx(c); caller != nil`
// — which is a no-op for a session cookie. So ~50 by-ID routes (agents,
// memory, documents, approvals, agent trees) reached another user's resources
// with nothing but a guessed id.
//
// This is the structural backstop, modelled on the WS gateway's
// dispatch_scope.go: rather than trusting ~50 present and future handlers to
// remember an ownership check, the route's own resource id is resolved to its
// owning workspace here, before dispatch. A newly added Office route is safe
// by default — and if it names a resource kind nobody registered a resolver
// for, it is DENIED rather than silently exempted. TestOfficeRouteScope
// Completeness turns that runtime denial into a build-time failure.

// officeRoutePrefix is the group the Office routes are mounted under. Route
// patterns are matched relative to it so the tables below read like the
// RegisterRoutes calls they mirror.
