// RowProcessLiveness reports the liveness of the OS process backing a row,
// branching on the row's runtime so that a host-local process check is NEVER
// applied to a remote row (#1597: executors_running.pid is the agentctl PID
// on the REMOTE host for SSH rows — never overload it with a local pid).
//
// It returns models.ProcessLiveness — a low-dependency type the orchestrator and
// task service can consume without importing runtime/lifecycle — so cleanup and
// reconciliation paths can classify a row through a small adapter method while
// the actual host-local probe stays in this platform-split package.
//
//   - local/standalone: judged by local_pid on this host.
//   - SSH/Kubernetes/remote: Unknown here. The agent process lives elsewhere;
//     SSH owns its remote `kill -0` probe and Kubernetes owns Pod status. Their
//     process identifiers must never be probed with a local os.FindProcess.
//   - docker / anything else: Unknown for now (out of scope for this batch).
