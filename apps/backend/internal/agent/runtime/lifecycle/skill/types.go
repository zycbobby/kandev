// Package skill is the runtime-tier implementation of per-profile skill
// and instruction-file deployment introduced in ADR 0005 Wave A. The
// package owns the manifest builder and the per-executor delivery
// strategies (local filesystem, Docker bind-mount, Sprites upload,
// SSH/SFTP upload). Wave E moved this code out of internal/office into the
// runtime so every launch (kanban or office) goes through the same
// path.
//
// Concrete office wiring is provided externally: the runtime accepts
// SkillReader / InstructionLister implementations that the office
// service exposes from its repository. The runtime never imports
// office; office never duplicates the deployer's logic.
