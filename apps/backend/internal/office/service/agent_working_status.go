// (scheduler_integration.go) accepts idle AND working, and
// ClaimNextEligibleRun does not filter on agent status at all, so no run
// is blocked and no schedule is skipped by this transition.

// has since re-marked the agent) is a no-op instead of clobbering the
// successor's live status. Callers that cannot resolve their own run's
// identity (a lifecycle event with no run_id) pass through whatever they
// have, including "" — that can only match an agent that was never marked
// working by the current, run-scoped code path, so it never clobbers a real
// in-flight run.
//
// Idempotent and safe to call from more than one path for the same run: the
// underlying CAS only fires while the agent is still "working" for that
// runID. It is therefore also safe to call after autoPauseAgent has paused
// the agent -- the pause wins and this becomes a no-op.
//
// The agent is looked up only when the status actually changed, so the
// common completion path pays for the extra read once per finished run
// rather than on every terminal transition (many of which never launched).
