// Office agent "working" status transitions.
//
// MarkAgentWorking and ClearAgentWorking are the only production writers of
// AgentStatusWorking.
//
// Both are compare-and-swap by design. An unconditional UPDATE would let a
// late-arriving reset clobber a status set by a concurrent, higher-priority
// writer — most dangerously autoPauseAgent (office/service/failure.go),
// which pauses an agent after consecutive failures on the very same code
// path that clears "working". A CAS makes each write a no-op unless the
// agent is still in a state the caller is entitled to transition from, so
// the reset can be called redundantly from any terminal path without
// resurrecting a paused, stopped, or pending-approval agent back to idle.
// MarkAgentWorking's CAS additionally allows one extra state: a launching
// run may take ownership from a same-agent predecessor that is still
// recorded "working" but whose run is no longer in-flight — see its own
// doc comment for why.

// resurrected. A false return means the agent was not idle and had no
// abandoned owner to take over from; it is not an error, and the run still
