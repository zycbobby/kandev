# Office — autonomous agent management

`internal/office/` implements Office: workspaces of long-running agents that pick up tasks, coordinate via handoffs, and report through a dashboard. This file routes you to the specs and records local traps; it does not restate either.

## Spec authority

`docs/specs/office/` (15 files) is the authority for what Office is and why — it outranks any card, register, or comment. **Where code and spec disagree, that is a defect in one of them; do not silently follow the code.** A sixteenth office-tagged spec, [per-agent + per-role tier selection](../../../../docs/specs/office-agent-tier-routing/spec.md), lives in a sibling directory, not under `docs/specs/office/`.

`office-agent-tier-routing/spec.md`'s own front matter still calls `routing.md` "authoritative" for tiers, provider order, execution profiles, provider health, and wake-reason policy — that predates `routing.md`'s archival in `docs/specs/INDEX.md` and is now stale; trust the INDEX status over the sibling spec's own text.

## Traps

- **A run is not a task start.** The `runs` table carries provider routing (`resolved_provider_id`, `logical_provider_order`, `requested_tier`, plus the `office_run_route_attempts` ledger), the per-reason `assembled_prompt`, the `AppendRunEvent` timeline, and retry/backoff/coalescing (`retry_count`, `earliest_retry_at`, `coalesced_count`, `idempotency_key` with unique index `idx_run_idempotency`). `Service.QueueRun` (`service/run.go`) and `SchedulerService.QueueRun` (`scheduler/run.go`) are the entry points that populate all of it; `TaskStarter` (the `StartTask` seam office calls, `service/service.go`) runs only *after*. Calling `StartTask` directly, or any ordinary kanban start path, skips all of the above. See `scheduler.md`.
- **`heartbeat` as a wake source is retired** (`scheduler.md`: routines are "the only mechanism for periodic wakes"; `wakeup/payloads.go` states `"heartbeat"` is intentionally absent from the `Source` enum) — but three literal `"heartbeat"` constants still exist in code (`scheduler/run.go`'s and `service/run.go`'s duplicate `RunReasonHeartbeat`, `routing/types.go`'s `WakeReasonHeartbeat`, still listed in `AllWakeReasons` and used to seed a `TierPerReason` policy in `onboarding/service.go`). `checkIdleSkip` (`service/scheduler_integration.go`) only applies when `run.Reason == RunReasonHeartbeat`, while the lightweight routine path sets `Reason: "routine_dispatch"` (`routines/service.go`, copied onto the run by `wakeup/dispatcher.go`). Check the reason string before assuming an idle-skip gate fires for a given run.
- **Continuation summary scope must come from `summaryScopeForRun`** (`service/event_subscribers.go`), never a literal string. Its sole caller, `refreshContinuationSummary`, upserts under the same value it reads, so reader and writer can't drift. Two scope forms exist: `routine:<id>` and `agent:<id>`; the legacy `"heartbeat"` scope is retired.
- **Participant slate: one builder, not office's own.** The AC-50 slate construction lives in `internal/workflow/engine` — `(*Engine).requiredSeats` / `requiredSeatsForWorkflow` (`workflow/engine/quorum.go`) — and `ResolveParticipantRole` (same file) reuses it so role resolution and slate membership can never disagree about who participates. Office reaches it through `engine_dispatcher.Dispatcher.ResolveParticipantRole`, which forwards verbatim. Do not add an office-local "who are this task's reviewers" query; that is a fourth answer to a question that already has exactly one.
- **Lightweight vs. heavy routines fail differently.** A routine with an empty `task_template` (`routines/service.go`; `CreateDefaultCoordinatorRoutine` sets `TaskTemplate: ""`, cron `*/5 * * * *`) is lightweight. Its **idle skip** — firing with no actionable task, launching nothing — is specified behavior (`scheduler.md`, telemetry `wakeup_idle_skipped`), not a bug; don't "fix" it. `checkIdleSkip` fails **open** on a DB error.
- **A new Office HTTP route must declare how it is scoped.** Office routes are keyed by a resource id far more often than by `:wsId`, so `officeWorkspaceScopeMiddleware` (`internal/backendapp/office_scope.go`) resolves the route's own ids to their owning workspace before dispatch — do not add a per-handler ownership check instead. A route naming a resource kind with no resolver is **denied**, and `TestOfficeRouteScopeCompleteness` turns that into a build failure. Adding a route means one of: register a `WorkspaceIDFor...` lookup in `office/repository/sqlite/workspace_scope.go` plus its `<collection>/:<param>` entry in `officeParamScopeResolvers`; list a child param in `officeScopedSubResourceParams`; or add it to `officeWorkspacelessRoutes`/`Prefixes` with the reason.
- **`:wsId` does not excuse the other ids on the same route.** `/workspaces/:wsId/labels/:id` and `/workspaces/:wsId/tasks/:taskId/...` reach handlers that act on the sibling id alone (`UpdateLabel(c.Param("id"))`, `ListLabelsForTask(c.Param("taskId"))`), ignoring the workspace they are mounted under — so a caller's own workspace id paired with a foreign label or task id was a cross-workspace read/mutation. The guard authorizes `:wsId` **and** every other resolvable param; the completeness test enforces the same.
- **An agent JWT is only workspace-checked where you check it.** `AgentAuthMiddleware` compares `claims.WorkspaceID` to `:wsId` and nothing else, and the handlers' own agent-caller guards (`agentCallerFromCtx` + `isAdminRole` / `caller.ID == target`) are role and identity checks, never workspace. A CEO-role token minted in workspace A could therefore act on a workspace B agent. `authorizeOfficeAgentCaller` resolves by-ID routes for agent callers too and requires every resolved workspace to equal the token's. Do not reintroduce a blanket `CallerFromContext(c) != nil { return nil }` early-out.
- **Ids on one route must resolve to the SAME workspace.** Authorizing each id on its own is not enough: a caller owning two workspaces passes the ownership check on both, so `/workspaces/<A2>/labels/<label in A1>` satisfied every individual check and still crossed a boundary. `officeRouteWorkspaces` refuses a route naming two workspaces; no Office route legitimately does (a task's reviewers, an agent's channels and runs, a workspace's labels are all intra-workspace). The quorum handler's hand-rolled `task.WorkspaceID != workspaceID` is the same rule patched per handler. `TestOfficeMultiIDRoutesRejectMixedWorkspaces` generates this check from the registered route table, so a new multi-id route is covered the day it is added.
- **Resolvers must fail closed.** They deliberately do not reuse `GetTaskWorkspaceID`/`GetProjectWorkspaceID` (`repository/sqlite/tasks.go`) — those return `("", nil)` for a missing row, and `AuthorizeWorkspaceAccess` reads `""` as "no scoping applies", i.e. allow everything.
- **Advancement has two signals.** An explicit `step_complete_kandev` MCP call (registered `mcp/server/server.go`, ADR 0015) and the turn-end path (`handleAgentReady`, `orchestrator/event_handlers_agent.go`), reconciled for late signals in `orchestrator/event_handlers_step_completion.go`. The per-step toggle `auto_advance_requires_signal` (`mcp/server/config_handlers.go`) couples them — know which one a step relies on before changing either.

## Package map

- `scheduler/` — wakeup queueing, run dispatch, idle skip, retry/backoff
- `service/` — core Office service: run lifecycle, event subscribers, continuation summaries
- `routines/` — routine (cron) definitions and dispatch, including the default coordinator routine
- `wakeup/` — wake payload/source/reason types and the dispatcher that turns them into runs
- `repository/sqlite/` — Office's SQLite tables (`runs`, route-attempt ledger, etc.)
- `routing/` — provider routing types; **spec archived**, package still live — exactly the kind of code/spec mismatch the precedence rule above exists for; readers wanting current routing behavior should start from `../agents/dynamic-agent-routing.md`
- `engine_dispatcher/` — office's bridge into `internal/workflow/engine` (participant roles, transitions)
- `engine_adapters/` — concrete adapters office supplies to the workflow engine (CEO, child-task creation, workflow switching); consumed from `internal/backendapp`
- `runtime/` — Office agent runtime wiring
- `summary/` — continuation summary storage
- `configloader/` — loads per-role agent instructions; `configloader/instructions/{ceo,devops,qa,reviewer,security,worker}/AGENTS.md` are the role-specific system prompts fed to each Office agent type, not developer docs. `ceo/` additionally has `HEARTBEAT.md`.
- `agents/`, `approvals/`, `channels/`, `config/`, `costs/`, `dashboard/`, `infra/`, `labels/`, `models/`, `onboarding/`, `projects/`, `shared/`, `skills/`, `testharness/`, `tree_controls/`, `truncate/`, `workspaces/` — one subpackage per dashboard/domain concept; names match the spec files above.
