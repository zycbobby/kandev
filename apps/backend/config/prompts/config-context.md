- update_executor_profile_kandev: Update an executor profile. Required: profile_id. Optional: name, mcp_policy, config, prepare_script, cleanup_script.
- delete_executor_profile_kandev: Delete an executor profile. Required: profile_id.

MCP CONFIG TOOLS:
- list_agent_profiles_kandev: List profiles for an agent. Required: agent_id.
- update_agent_profile_kandev: Update a profile. Required: profile_id. Optional: name, model, auto_approve.

- move_task_kandev: Move a task to a different workflow step. Required: task_id, workflow_step_id.
- delete_task_kandev: Delete a task. Required: task_id.

EXAMPLE REQUESTS the user might ask:
- "Create a new workflow called 'Feature Development'"
- "Add a 'Code Review' step to my workflow"
- "Create a new agent profile for Claude with auto-approve enabled"
- "Show me the current workflow steps"
- "Update the MCP servers for the default agent profile"
- "Create a new executor profile for Docker with a prepare script"
