/**
 * Tracks whether the dockview panel identified by panelId is the visible tab
 * in its dockview group. Portal-hosted panel content (see
 * `lib/layout/panel-portal-manager.ts`) stays mounted while its tab is
 * inactive — e.g. the Chat tab keeps running behind an active Files/Changes
 * tab — so components that must distinguish "mounted" from "actually on
 * screen" (like the unread-divider read tracker) need this signal rather
 * than assuming mount implies visibility.
 *
 * Backed by `panelPortalManager` since portal-hosted content only receives
 * its `panelId`, not the dockview api directly; `usePortalSlot`'s mount
 * effect acquires the portal entry (with its api) before any child content
 * renders, so the entry is virtually always present by the time this runs.
 * Subscribes to both the manager's own add/remove notifications (a panel
 * acquired after this hook's first mount, or released while it stays
 * mounted) and the panel's own `onDidVisibilityChange` (tab switches within
 * an existing group). Dockview's `isActive` also requires the panel's group
 * to own global focus, so it is not a valid proxy for whether the panel is
 * rendered on screen beside another focused group.
 *
 * Only for dockview-hosted panels — pass the panel's real id. Defaults to
 * `false` until a portal entry/api is actually registered for it, rather
 * than assuming visibility during the brief acquire/mount race or after a
 * panel has been detached: a false negative just delays marking the session
 * read by a render, while a false positive could mark it read too early.
 * Non-dockview hosts (mobile, quick chat, kanban preview) never acquire a
 * portal entry — they should pass a literal `true`/`false` instead of
 * calling this hook.
