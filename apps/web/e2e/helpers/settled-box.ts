 * Scroll `locator` into view and resolve its bounding box once it stops moving.
 *
 * `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` resolves before an animated or momentum scroll has
 * finished, so reading `boundingBox()` straight afterwards can capture
 * coordinates that are already stale by the time a pointer event is dispatched
 * at them. Drag helpers that then aim at those coordinates miss their target
 * intermittently.
 *
 * Poll until two consecutive samples agree rather than sleeping for a budget
 * that is guessed rather than measured: this returns as soon as the element is
 * actually still, and keeps waiting when the scroll or an opening animation is
 * slow. Position and dimensions are sampled together so a centered dialog
 * cannot be reported settled while its scale animation is still changing its
 * width.
