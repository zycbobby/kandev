/**
 * Image used by the SSH executor's e2e tests. Built once per machine and
 * reused. Tag is stable so Docker's layer cache survives across runs.
 *
 * The image carries:
 *   - openssh-server + openssh-sftp-server (the remote target)
 *   - git + bash + curl + sudo + coreutils (for prepare scripts and broker health checks)
 *   - iproute2 + iptables (for fault-injection: drop traffic mid-session)
 *   - a pre-baked `mock-agent` binary at /usr/local/bin/mock-agent so the
 *     agentctl process the SSH executor uploads has something to spawn when
 *     the orchestrator asks for an agent subprocess.
 *
 * The `agentctl` binary is NOT baked in — the e2e tests verify the actual
 * SFTP upload + sha256-cache path the production code uses.
