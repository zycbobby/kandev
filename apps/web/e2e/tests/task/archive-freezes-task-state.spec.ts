// Regression: archiving a task must freeze its runtime `state`. Several
// backend reconcile paths (turn completion, turn cancel, failed-start
// fallback, and startup/crash reconciliation) used to write tasks.state to
// REVIEW whenever the *session* looked idle/failed, without checking
// whether the *task* had since been archived. Once a task was archived
// while its session was still active, any of those paths — including a
// plain agent.cancel — silently resurrected the archived task's state,
// which is the "archived task comes back with the wrong state after a
// crash/restart" bug. This test reproduces the live (non-restart) trigger
// deterministically: the E2E harness seeds the persisted RUNNING session
// state, then the test archives the task and cancels the turn via the same WS
// action the chat toolbar's Cancel button sends. Seeding the state avoids
// coupling this regression to the mock executor's startup timing.
