/**
 * The app's first-party navigation catalog: one declaration per top-level
 * destination, in the order surfaces should offer them.
 *
 * Why this exists: each surface used to hardcode its own list. Adding a
 * destination meant editing three unrelated files, and forgetting one silently
 * dropped it from that surface — `/stats` was reachable only from the
 * desktop-only sidebar footer and a keyboard-only palette command, so it had no
 * phone entry point at all. `core-destinations.test.ts` now fails when a
 * first-class route has no manifest entry, or when a destination is missing from
 * the mobile menu without a recorded reason.
 *
 * What this manifest currently drives: the sidebar's integrations section and
 * footer insight buttons, the sidebar and mobile plugin nav groups, the shared
 * `AppNavSections` block (the mobile nav sheet and the kanban drawer's global
 * tail), the topbar's home crumb (via `homeDestinationHref`), and the command
 * palette's Navigation group.
 *
 * What it does not drive yet (deliberately, see the notes below): the sidebar's
 * primary nav, action-shaped controls (New task, Inbox, quick chat, the
 * settings gear, the Office↔Kanban switch), the settings tree, and Office's own
 * navigation section — the latter two travel as `pageNav` through `PageShell`
 * instead of flattening into this catalog.
