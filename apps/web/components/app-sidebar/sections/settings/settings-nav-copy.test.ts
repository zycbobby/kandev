 * Byte-for-byte pin on the settings nav's English copy.
 *
 * Externalizing a string can silently REWRITE it: point a label at an existing
 * key whose wording has drifted and lint, `i18n:check`, the ratchet and the unit
 * suite all still pass — the string is externalized, the key exists, the
 * catalogs are in sync. Nothing downstream compares the rendered sentence to
 * what users saw before.
 *
 * Nav labels are the sharpest case, because the same word usually exists twice:
 * once here, and once as the route's own page title in
 * `components/settings/settings-layout-client.tsx`. These assertions are the
 * diff, kept.
